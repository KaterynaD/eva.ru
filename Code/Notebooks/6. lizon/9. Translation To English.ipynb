      "And our eldest son, in high school, in French, was once asked to write \"I'm proud because I'm black.\" But this is the same essay, that I'm proud of what a white person would think of as racism. Is it fair? I then wrote an indignant letter in the lyceum.\n",
      "I think, in principle, it is necessary to know the history of Christianity, at least for the general culture (all classical painting, according to the Bible). I will not say that my husband is a fanatic, but according to observations, his blind faith does not really help him, on the contrary.\n",
      "Not quite so. I would prefer my son (about whom I speak, the youngest) to be less idealistic in life than my husband, da.Less idealistic is easier to live with. Of course, there are qualities in a husband that I do not like, I think it is rare to meet a wife who is satisfied with absolutely everything in her husband, this has no influence on love.\n",
      "Well, I mean, you need to know the Bible for general culture, at least schematically. My youngest son goes to kindergarten, and my granddaughter (I mean her when I say \"children\") goes to primary school.\n",
      "Listen, I even think that now, because of political correctness (her mother), state schools will start to talk more about the Koran than about the Bible. My eldest, when I was still in high school, wait, they were asked to write an essay on the topic \"I am proud to be black.\"\n",
      "They don't clone. My youngest son is five years old. My granddaughter (the daughter of an adult son who is 26 years old) is 6 and a half, almost seven. She spends a lot of time with us, almost all weekends and school holidays, so my husband says goodbye to both of us. I don't believe you about falling in love.\n",
      "I don't know, I don't know. In principle, yes, prayer, why not. But what I really don't want is for my son to be the same, too pious, as my husband.\n",
      "And I made a mistake, long ago, with my eldest son. He graduated from kindergarten and had to go to primary school already. And he seemed so small yet, so defenseless somehow, that I wrote a letter to the kindergarten principal (we have kindergarten and primary school in the same system) and asked for another year to duplicate in kindergarten.\n",
      "And I often watch the first channel, well, let's get married there, Lies Detector, etc.\n",
      "I didn't even know about Tanya and Wanya. I (and my son) know the barmaid from mullet Dr. Aybolit, there he (B.) - in Africa - put the animals behind bars, and Aybolit came to their aid.\n",
      "My granddaughter doesn't believe in Kashpirovsky at all. My son, just in case, does what I say to him, but with skepticism. You see, we adults, we laugh when we talk about Kashpirovsky, the children feel that we laugh, we laugh at us. Right, it's funny. Today, my eldest son and daughter-in-law came back from vacation, so my eldest son confirmed that since he saw Kashpirovsky one day, he has been so obedient since then.\n",
      "I often (all weekends) have my granddaughter, she is almost 7, my youngest son is 5. They have been sleeping together for many years, they don't think differently at the same time. (My baby sleeps in a room on a large double mattress, so there is enough space for them) Perhaps soon they will have to be weaned off.\n",
      "Horrible, author, I don't even know what to advise. Is he the only child in the family? Do you have friends with children of about the same age? Then make the most of weekends with friends and children to make friends with someone outside of school.\n",
      "I know your problem, I am completely for you in this matter, the only way out is to move to my own house. When we lived in the apartment, I did not allow my first son to play ball at home, I limited noisy games to the maximum.\n",
      "I, too, would only be in favor. It's not even about checking how the caregivers treat the children (we have, I'm sure, normal) - but it's interesting to watch my son from the sidelines, as he does with other children.\n",
      "I am not that proud, but I am terribly glad that I have 2 sons, the second also wanted a son, although I would also love the girl to the point of oblivion of course. My husband raved only about his son.\n",
      "I also say this to a friend who has a daughter, but I speak only to make her happy. She recently gave birth. In fact, I don't envy her having a daughter, but I do have sons.\n",
      "That's another reason, maybe for a strange reason, I would not want a girl - I think that if there were a girl, but not an unconditional rare beauty, I would be bitter and sick for her all my life. Yes, so, my daughter would like to have a dazzling beauty. But this is a lottery, most children get neither particularly beautiful nor particularly ugly, unconditional beauties are a rarity, I have a granddaughter like that, fortunately.\n",
      "My friend, the mother of my daughter, says what kind of sweet son you have, I tell her, and you have a daughter, a Karasotulet girl, I would like that too. I won't tell her that I am terribly glad that I didn't have a daughter, but a son was born, won't I?\n",
      "No. I do not give birth for showmanship. If I had MY daughter, I would like her beauty to eclipse all - not for my vanity, but for her happiness. Beauty is not always born of beautiful parents, ugly children often get from beautiful parents and back, there is little connection.\n",
      "In comparison, my youngest son, my granddaughter's uncle, is the most beautiful boy in the world for me. But for boys, physical beauty is a completely different category than for girls.\n",
      "participation in publicity + external data allowed to enroll her out of competition in a stage studio in Paris where it is so easy not to get. This is in addition to the theatre courses where I take them with my youngest son once a week A we do not paint her about her beauty, lives like all children live, goes to school and everything else.\n",
      "I babysit my eldest son's daughter all the time they ask, which is perfectly normal, they want to go to the disco and go to parties with friends and generally.\n",
      "I do not know your match situation, but if I had an apartment for rent and my son's family without housing, I would not be able to rent them out.\n",
      "I, too, had a son at that age who had balbes, but I didn't wear a skull, but in the last year of high school I brought home a girl 3 years older to live with us, she got pregnant, he knocked on 18 and we married them, and then it was a year-long nightmare in general. I didn't finish school, and I didn't know where to go, I just didn't turn up for my bachelor's exam.\n",
      "The author, mention in your novel for fun (it is true) - on a certain island of the South Pacific, the natives lived, indiscriminately converged with each other and did not know at all that there was a connection between sexual act and pregnancy, so there was no such thing, not even the word \"father\" in their language.\n",
      "Then they came back and now they come (son, his wife and granddaughter) - every weekend, we have another son. Together we go to events, to restaurants, to parks for children, we have a barbecue, we spend holidays together. We no longer have a family, but a clan. So it's different.\n",
      "I gave birth at 20 and 42. If I didn't have children, I would start thinking like that from the moment I realized I couldn't give birth anymore, at 20 or 40 it didn't matter.\n",
      "I don't know.... They've been friends for 8 years after all. Then, I suppose, it's difficult especially at first to raise a child alone. My brother's wife has a husband-brother, and she probably doesn't suffer. For me personally, the concept of friendship is sacred. I'll do for my girlfriends what my relatives often don't.\n",
      "Unfortunately, I can't get a smear twice a year: after all, my husband's parents. Uncles and aunts are all long in the murky past, fortunately.\n",
      "Author. My son brought home to live a non-working girl when he was 17 years old (he studied at the lyceum) and she was 20 years old. They lived for a year and a half (and got married when my son turned 18) I don't go into details because then there was drama. I treated the girl like a daughter for the whole year and a half. She didn't steal anything from me because she and I were about the same size and I said myself that wear what you like from my clothes.\n",
      "I don't want my son (the youngest, with the oldest clearly) to become a homic I want him to live a full social life, to have a normal family and children, da.I have homo and lesbians among my good friends, I communicate with them perfectly normally. But I strongly oppose their right to adopt, for example.\n",
      "Of course, we will always love our children, homics or not. I don't care what they say about me.\n",
      "And she's a good person, your mother-in-law? Judging by the description, you're moving soon. Don't tell her not to climb, author! She's sad that she lost her son, and now it's right that she wants to be closer to you and her grandson.\n",
      "But outside of that, she is an adequate person, earns well, is not an alcoholic and, most importantly, she loves her daughter and her daughter loves her, so it was inhumane to start suing even my granddaughter (my husband and I disagree) in any case, my daughter-in-law knows that she can count on me 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for the good of me hardly work.\n",
      "Yes, she apparently changed her mind after Vietnam, and when her son announced that she was divorcing, she begged him not to do so, you can hear the wild scenes and shouts on the phone, her hysterics, and asked me to help (I helped for about a week, urged my son not to divorce tearfully), then the situation was considered and dissuaded from divorce stopped. My daughter-in-law told me so, I love your son, but I will go to live with another man (his name).\n",
      "And where is my husband to go? And where is my youngest son? And my mother is still on the run from prison, so it's not going to be a combination.\n",
      "Personally, I would give everything in the world to one of my twins who would not have survived and now there would be two babies instead of one, although material life would have deteriorated. They would have been each other's support since childhood, right from kindergarten.\n",
      "So if the third child is already born on our territory? We may well soon have such a situation that the eldest son will move to live with us, and not even alone, but with a new friend and her son who is 4 years old. We have a very small house, we will have this arrangement on each other's heads, but I will never refuse.\n",
      "There is nothing catastrophic about the author's situation. No. No. Your reaction is exactly stormy and inadequate. You all exaggerate and exaggerate everything. If you look at the situation ideally, no one can give birth to 3 or 2 children, except outright rich.\n",
      "And we have one common living room, our bedroom, a child's bedroom and 2 additional rooms, for guests and if the eldest son moves with a new girlfriend and son, until they find their accommodation.\n",
      "We used to have a son with his wife and daughter every weekend, now more often a son with a new girlfriend and her son. Normal, it's possible to live, children run all day in the garden if it's not raining.\n",
      "You are also extremely lucky to have been able to give birth after that. I have a friend who did it once, and then it doesn't work out. I also had 2 a., but it is better not to think about it.\n",
      "It was a crazy New Year's Eve. My baby was my youngest son, there was still a lady, my granddaughter., so they got up and danced. 'There was nothing obscene or vulgar in the pictures or that night, the eldest son was a DJ and we sat down and danced all night.\n",
      "In the New Year's photos, they seem to still be there, but after 3 days, the top is called the Pravda Narodna about Lyson - of pure French people only my husband, Luda's husband. My daughter-in-law is half-Vietnamese, and my 2 sons are half-Russian. Ryska and Luda are also Russian. Of course, there are many French acquaintances - in principle.\n",
      "Brulick, thank you on a good word!!!!! Dear girls, want a gift for March 8? Food for thought? Well, Raphael's photo sure you'll get a fig. But look if you love me again, he's fawning over me.\n",
      "The doctor is afraid to tell him, sends a nurse, says, tell him that there has been a mutation at the gene level. The nurse is afraid of the barn, sends a plumber, says, tell your father that there has been a mutation at the gene level.\n",
      "Well, I read the whole topic with interest, wondering how things are with disco in Russia. Why not just tell us how it is with us? Frankly speaking, I don't even want to talk about my daughter-in-law. As long as everything is hanging in the backum, my son and daughter come every weekend.\n",
      "Well, purely objectively, my daughter-in-law is not a beauty. Yes, of course, there is the allure of youth, but that's all.\n",
      "No. It was my dad until he divorced my mother, who was terribly amused that I mispronounced the letter sh, instead of re-learning it, my dad evaporated after a year, and the defect remained.\n",
      "I won't give it. So I took it and gave it a link here - so that the girls from Yerevan who don't like me, and who speak the same languages here, they will go to those forums to write nice things about me.... Or maybe I'll give you the phone number of my husband and all sorts of different friends and a personal address, eh?\n",
      "To my daughter-in-law? So they still live together with my son in the same apartment, so the divorce will go on for a long time. It's not even about where, but how do I look her in the eye and what to say after my husband (my) has told me about her.\n",
      "It is not my son, it is my husband who told me (last February she had a horrible gossip about me). I agree that it is in vain. I have been silent all year, but here I gave it away, precisely because there is almost a war between them (I am neutral). My son will soon start looking for an apartment to move to as soon as possible.\n",
      "Yes, you are right. Strangely, sometimes it seems to me that Eva is the source of the only gloating, sometimes communication here is very easy and really people give the right advice. I listen to you, I will divide in half. The fact is that the daughter-in-law herself started the story with her lover, and now, when the son also found a woman, she changed her mind abruptly (apparently her new man is not very happy to take her with the girl), she gets hysterical every day, threatens to throw herself out of the window, and so on.\n",
      "So what do you advise me to do? Intervene to separate my granddaughter from her trustworthy mother? Or not to intervene? Or do you not believe me and think that I am inventing facts? My son, of course, wanted to stay with his daughter himself. Do you think I am speaking against my daughter-in-law? Think as you wish.\n",
      "She is very talented, penetrative, clever and very cunning. They have lived with my son for 8 years. During this time, she went to another lover, for a few months and then returned to her son. Semen life certainly did not go smoothly for them, I do not pose as an angel neither son nor her. She started her kebabs with her lover and the first announced that she was getting divorced.\n",
      "No, why. I think if my son decided to come and introduce her to us, then he really loved it, we want to believe it. The difficulty here is that this woman lives 300 km away, with her parents, without a job or profession, it is not clear how and where they and her son will live together in this scenario, especially if she has a boy.\n",
      "It is impossible to predict anything in advance, but one wants to believe in people. And how can he get away with it? She is clearly not a hunter of a rich man (my son is not rich), the fact that an independent mother is probably better, they already know life and the child imho cannot be an obstacle.\n",
      "But I don't interfere, I think about myself, I only share this thought with my husband and my friends, and I tell my son that everything is fine.\n",
      "My daughter-in-law has 7 Fridays a week. They seem to have decided that they will come for the weekend with their granddaughter, they have arrived, this morning my daughter-in-law calls and demands that her granddaughter be returned - her husband takes her, they live 50 km away. Then she called my son on his cell phone all day long.\n",
      "They understand!!!!!! We discuss, of course, everything with my husband, I am on the phone with my friends, I am here on the forum. I would not build a relationship with this new girl in the place of my son, for example, but I will never tell him that.\n",
      "I don't understand roubles, author. When I had similar situations in my life - it was like that at the beginning of our family life - I got a job for a week or a few days for very low jobs, such jobs can always be found in megacities, no?\n",
      "I tell my son that there are people who believe in God the Pope, for example, and there are those who do not believe in me.\n",
      "I long ago insisted that my eldest son (also in winter) be left in kindergarten for an extra year, as you thought. But then I very much regretted this decision.\n",
      "We have been fighting with my son for years to eat. He is a little boy. Today, I thought that lunch would be a picnic, found some blanket, spread out in here he sits happily and eats. And at the table, at home or anywhere else. Is the method to spread further, or is sitting so bad for the back? (Although in Arab countries, it is often only eaten on the floor)?\n",
      "It's a huge chance to get beauty from birth. It's just like that. It's a huge and rare gift from fate. Otherwise, a child needs to be developed like everyone else, with pros and cons. But naturally, whoever is born beautiful, it will be easier and more pleasant to live with, this is a fact.\n",
      "This cleans up the complexes, gives confidence and perfectly develops the personality. And since September, I have wanted to record my son myself for music (probably for 1 year there will be a solfedjo, then there will be a piano) and my husband has even planned to record him for a catechesis - that personally seems to me to be an absolute waste of time.\n",
      "I thought about it, but it seems that the girls are amused by the reaction of their son when he is offended and weeping. Well, they will play together whatever I propose, and then demonstratively hold hands and go to another place. No, unfortunately, we don't have any other boys we know.\n",
      "Well, yes, I try. They can climb trees, for example.\n",
      "They shouldn't, heh, of course. Just now I'll have to tell my girlfriend to bring her daughter ONLY when my son is alone. Today was the last day they lived together with us. I'm kind of in tears most of all, you know. It's going to be my son or he's with his granddaughter or he's with his girlfriend's daughter.\n",
      "In his house, at home, during the holidays, he will no longer cry from Ignore, that is all. I do not blame anyone and it is probably logical that the girls have become friends with him. All three beautiful children. And yet my son will not suffer any more, one-on-one with each of the girls he is a calm and happy boy.\n",
      "Well, yes, a good idea. The strangest thing is that all three are angels separately. They also provoke (tells me to do this or that), especially my granddaughter, on what my son is doing naughty things, I swear at him, he's in tears, those two are laughing, mine is crying even more and so on. No, we have to stop, we are fed up and unfair to our son.\n",
      "That's what I'm saying. I didn't think I'd face such a problem. The first time it happened yesterday, the second time today. I tried to solve the problem by dealing with them all - it didn't work out.\n",
      "My son and granddaughter get along perfectly when they are alone. My daughter's girlfriend (a very sweet girl) will come to us only on days when her granddaughter is not there. Initially, my daughter's girlfriend was my son's girlfriend. Naturally, the three of them will not socialize any more. So my son will keep his niece (naturally) and my daughter's girlfriend as a friend.\n",
      "What kind of friendship can there be between 4 and 8 years old? We have: my granddaughter (seven and a half) constantly tells her uncle (six years) to do different things. The last time they both swore to me that I would not go to the end of the garden to watch them play. After a couple of hours, I became worried and went. It turns out that my granddaughter encouraged my son to climb over the fence (it is not high there) and walk there alone in a clean field.\n",
      "I can. Because my other son will be 27 years old.... So I can roughly predict my upbringing and what comes out of it, draw conclusions, compare, yes.\n",
      "For example, I have a few children here. They roam in the garden, led by their son. I explain that they can go to the house to shout, but in the garden they disturb the neighbors, or maybe people can rest. The explanations don't work.\n",
      "We have a round pool, it has bubble film to attract heat, on top of all there is a huge inflatable mattress, with very high sides and the thickness of the mattress is large, it is square and occupies almost the entire surface of the pool (3 meters in diameter). When you lie on this mattress, you don't feel any water, with the film, moreover, it just swerves on the water, inside is absolutely dry.\n",
      "Yes, of course, but I would like to be stress-free, as long as every time he comes here he starts fighting and fighting with me. Actually, my question is, do you think it's because he's not used to it?\n",
      "By the way, I will never give them the youngest on Wednesday, I do not trust them so much. By the way, they have already arrived, have dinner, will leave the little one and will leave. To be fair, when, without a mother, the boy is more balanced and obedient, I will see what will happen tomorrow.\n",
      "My eldest will be 28, my youngest 7. Nothing to do with it, on the contrary, I mean the eldest to the youngest. The oldest daughter is older than the younger brother, and the eldest understands very well that now my attention and various material things and he and my granddaughter will be much less than if he were our only son.\n",
      "And after the birth of the second one, I had the idea of giving birth to a third. I conceived and gave birth. And I shared my thoughts with my eldest. He obviously didn't sleep all night, he called me from the very morning to dissuade me from such a step.\n",
      "Well, my husband bought a new supposedly hair-cutting machine, began to cut his son (7 years old to him) and suddenly it turns out that I shave completely naked and how to adjust the length - not at all - of that machine. Do you think it will affect the child's psyche? From yesterday, I put a casket over his head at school. When will the hair grow up?\n",
      "I can't help but boast about my son's first successful concert! I've just returned. How can I persuade him to play at home for an hour a day at the very least. (rather than poking fun at him) My eldest graduated from music, you would have heard him play Chopin (well, forgive my maternal pride and bragging) - in my opinion, the piano is better than the instrument....\n",
      "Thank you! Of course, my son could not play F. Chopin's Fantasia-Impromt, but he was encouraged, did not mess with the notes, and, most importantly, was not shy at all (unlike the older one). I am terribly proud.\n",
      "Yes, a photo subscription is obligatory, but with the condition that you first take a close-up shot of your hemorrhoid (which raises so much bile in you, it hurts to sit at the computer, I understand. Japan sells special cushions for hemorrhoids, search on the Internet) And if you are shy about a photo shoot, don't burn, I will soon show you the Cuban photos of my son, which you prefer, on the beaches of the Atlantic or the Caribbean? And next year (if all is well), I will show you Vegas photos.\n",
      "I didn't intend to make music my profession, but just learn to play the piano. The goal for my son is the same. Here, too, we wanted to join the choir (in principle, it is also obligatory), but I asked, this year, for the choir and the second instrument. I hope, in the new academic year, it will be met again, especially since September, my husband wants to record it for coughing and swimming.\n",
      "At 14, rich parents will send their son's friend to England, to a prestigious high school. And nifig didn't achieve this himself, but his parents paid for it. And what is the answer for a 14-year-old son who will ask why I can't?\n",
      "So your son will soon have 3 mugs, a swimming pool, music and that's it... up to. But how does your time go? If you are in Russia, it means he goes to school 5 days a week. Mugs on Saturdays? And after school? Maybe your mug... before they really teach the children... up to. And today I sat in the gym for an hour, watching what they do. I thought it was some kind of charlatanism. Children in white kimonos are running erratically and very conditionally repeating the exercises shown by the trainer.\n",
      "The child has absolutely nothing to do with it. He would dictate something to us, right now. This husband is hysterical. I myself go a lot during the year, and with him and the child in the summer, once a year only, on his vacation. It's just difficult with money now, so he was sitting at the computer, looking for the cheapest options, but very far from France. He says that he has been working all year and wants to change ideas.\n",
      "When my son was 17 years old and he brought a girl to live in the house, she was 19 and a half years old, like your daughter, and then they married. So they lived with my son in the room, and there, to get through the door, you had to almost use a machete knife (this is how the Amazon paves the way in the jungle). There were plates everywhere on the floor with malnourished food and even the walls were doused with coffee (they once swore and the daughter-in-law spat out her mug of coffee on her son, and he stood next to the wall) Then it had to be repaired in the room.\n",
      "Here. And she was very sorry to inform her son of this information. Does this mean that her current new love is limping? By the way, our granddaughter today, look at us.\n",
      "If my son does not make an official ban, he can take it anywhere. I myself flew with him to Russia for holidays when the eldest was small, many years ago, no one at the airport asked his father's permission to take it out.\n",
      "So there was no need for me to recognize this information. I told my son that it was probably true. But let him call the prefecture himself to find out if I called grandma - it would look strange.\n",
      "So it would be better for everyone if her life with that man went smoothly and for her granddaughter, too.\n",
      "But the system itself is that some girl decided to control her classmates. This is illegitimate and against the rules of the school. I would tell the teacher that my son would not show any of his tasks to this girl.\n",
      "Personally, I gave birth to my second child at the age of 42 and we moved to live in the village, changed our lives radically, we can say we started life with a new leaf (the eldest son separated). But personally, my life was the happiest and most interesting from 30 to 40, it was probably the happiest peak.\n",
      "I will tell you about myself that the attitude towards my own child is still more reverent than towards my grandson. My youngest son is a year and a half younger than my granddaughter, the attitude towards them is a bit different, of course, the son is closer to me.\n",
      "Well, my husband doesn't even know how to repair the tap in the bathroom, not like a car. It was necessary to tow anyway in the nearest town, and at night it is closed. In general, my son has already solved the problem, for 280 euros, there was a breakdown there.\n",
      "We live 100 km from Paris, son - in the middle of the road, 50 km. By taxi he would have gone, it would have turned out very expensive, he was near the metro station, a direct line to the station, from which there are trains, both to him and to us (we are on the same line)\n",
      "Well, I won't be offended by your condemnation, I blame myself, but I meant that my son himself wouldn't go 50 km by taxi and wouldn't want to pay for it, people usually travel by public transport for such distances, especially since the communication is convenient subway + train and he is at home.\n",
      "What to think there. I have such a wardrobe that I will close my eyes, put my hand on something and it will be guaranteed to be a nice little thing. I can show later, we will all be photographed there together. True, my son called yesterday and asked, laughing, that I dress not as always, but strictly, I said that I do not have strict clothes.\n",
      "How can he be impotent when we have made two sons? Where do I know who you mean by impotent... you haven't explained anything about your husband.\n",
      "Is it you about yesterday's photo? It's in my son's apartment, and usually the mess there is such that you have to get through the room with a machete knife, as in the jungle (as we were led by a guide in the Amazon once) - to pave the way.... Yes, my son works in computer science and is crazy about the latest models, he has only two stationary ones.\n",
      "... my whole life I have been questioned with the eldest, so my son or brother With the youngest, no one has ever asked my grandmother or my mother even if my granddaughter is older than the youngest.\n",
      "The bailiffs will find out that she has part of the estate (there is a national real estate registry) and put the house up for sale.\n",
      "The majority of the population takes out a mortgage and pays it off for 20 years. The bank will give him a mortgage at the maximum of his salary for 20 years or so. That is, for the necessary additional repairs, he will have to take an additional loan from the condominium and tighten his belts.\n",
      "I rarely work and I don't plan on going any further. The world we have almost all traveled. We live in a happy place, we love our house and we don't want to move anywhere. I've been growing roses and fruit there for a long time. One son is already living his adult life, so I don't expect any absolutely global changes.\n",
      "It is. My ex-daughter-in-law quietly hates her new friend, it is strange. She is doing well. But this is how life turns strange. I personally now have more sympathy and communication with my ex-daughter-in-law. She recently gave birth to another daughter-in-law - by a new man, with whom she now lives.\n",
      "The author, I am 49, I am already a grandmother for more than 8 years. I would be 7 heaven with happiness if my elders offered me to sit with my granddaughter for at least as long as possible. I still have another son, he is younger than my granddaughter and they are like brother and sister when together.\n",
      "Well, everyone lives as they want, the flag is in your hands, because your friend, 70 years old, said so. Or it happens in the first year after birth. Then comes happiness and replenishment of the family, more joy. Personally, if I could not have children, I would not live at all. What is there after 70 years I personally do not care. I live today and prefer that the day be not lonely, but with children.\n",
      "My son now has a new girlfriend, Jessica and she is 22 years old, everything he told me about her. And he doesn't want to bring her with him, he says he will know when I'm sure it's serious. I wanted to send him to my mum's in Peter in the summer so he could get to know someone there seriously.\n",
      "And so you can call it that. My son and dad asks me to pick him up for a block, he wants to appear independent. But when I pick him up he always asks me to pick him up, because then he is proud to be the center of attention, but now it's winter, it's mud, I don't take a goat in the car with dirty cats.\n",
      "I don't know how I would have lived if I hadn't decided to give birth to my second child at 42. The difference between my sons is 21 years old. The only thing I regret is that I didn't give birth to other children at the time.\n",
      "A large family is a rare happiness. And the ideal period when you have to sacrifice something and at least for 2 years (pregnancy, the first difficult year) suspend work-study, etc., such a moment will NEVER come.\n",
      "... is jealous of the youngest, 7 and a half years old. He certainly does not like him. And I was hoping for 2 brothers in life - real mutual support in the future. The union creates strength. Do you think it's normal, jealousy at such an age?\n",
      "He works, of course. He is divorced from his wife, he rarely sees his daughter now, we see her even less often, she is older than my youngest son.\n",
      "Well, yes, children from one father. It will not be possible to take the eldest with him on holidays either financially and he has a new girlfriend, he has always, and with his wife and the second and that's probably why he will go to the South of France.\n",
      "My father was always in a bad relationship with him. Then the elder committed meanness and his life went under the knife. Then the younger was born and now the father compensates for his dislike of the older by adoring the younger immeasurably.\n",
      "Yes, I am also interested in a jope from space. The boys have one father because now my 7-year-old is an exact copy of my hacked son, when he was 7 years old.\n",
      "Traitor. Even in Arab and black bullying families, for example, the Kroncontingent that I hate - even there the sons of mothers do not betray THAT. I have not told you all about it yet. I almost put my hands on myself at the time.\n",
      "I found one (one of the three closest for many years) in a shop, one of the ASH and EM boutiques in our shopping center! She noticed that my eldest sons and I had exchanged phrases in Russian, and she heard it.\n",
      "Good luck to you, and my wishes are coming true.\n",
      "Because a family with many children and a smaller age difference than mine - families are happier than one, imho.Union is a strength. Then a woman can not work, but receive decent social benefits, and give time to children than nurseries.\n",
      "Hee hee, or for the great-grandson of Lieutenant Schmidt. Absolutely not like him. Did you not see him once in my videos and in the photo? About the adventure, from myself I will add-fool-agree.\n",
      "Of course, it is not even a matter for us. Guests only sometimes bring dessert. We produce champagne in our village, and drink it, and we make a BBQ in the evening. Only as you know, despite friends, it will be more empty, because the family of the eldest son has disintegrated.\n",
      "Their divorce is set for March 8, she has already moved in with her daughter to live with a new man. We don't see our granddaughter any more, which breaks my heart. My son, yes, is dating that girl, but she lives 300 km away from him.\n",
      "At that time, I had 3 most critical moments. 1. when my first son left the family and we didn't have news from him for a year. 2. when I was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, I could have died, and there was a 6-month-old baby. 3. I don't want to tell you.\n",
      "No, my granddaughter's mother is not with us today. There is a new friend of my son in the photo. My granddaughter's mother will celebrate her birthday tomorrow, already with a new family.\n",
      "So long ago, everything changed. My son and his wife divorced. My ex-wife lives with a new man and is already pregnant with him. My son's new girlfriend is in the video and in the photos.\n",
      "If they are strangers, I don't know how many such families there are in the world, if they are relatives or friends or acquaintances, then of course they are.\n",
      "The friend took one skull and put it in a bag. And at the exit it turns out that the bags were checked (and the stolen skulls were already on the table) So my son and I shamelessly abandoned our friend in trouble, left first, and he blew himself up as if he had come to steal.\n",
      "I do not see my son regularly with my married-divorced son, who now lives with a new girl. Sometimes I see him every weekend, sometimes I have not seen him for 2 months. He works. He lives 50 km away from us.\n",
      "One day, when my eldest was about 13 years old, he and I climbed on a fair with a view to a not-so-scary attraction. There you sit in a cab and it starts spinning. It was horrible. My son shouted to me under the watch- guard, help me. And in Las Vegas, on one of the palaces, at the end of the Strip, the stratosphere is called, there is a terrible attraction on the roof, there are rods right on the roof, there are armchairs around him, people are fastened to them, and this rods falls down by free fall.\n",
      "He is hardly happy. When I am told about my grown-up children, how they got on well in life - they bought a house - people's children remind me every time of my poor son, and accordingly, it is unpleasant to listen to such things.\n",
      "Buy your daughter a phone! I have 2 sons. When the first one became an adult man, and time passed imperceptibly - that's the wisdom I learned from it. We need to maximize the joy of childhood for children. We need to make childhood as fun as possible for them. Then, as adults, they become more confident in themselves. That's why I try to deliver the child's joy as much as possible.\n",
      "And I don't even try to help do dz. My husband does it. Sometimes I help only in French. I can understand the logic of grammar better than he can. In general, my son usually does everything himself, my husband only checks.\n",
      "My husband bought a play set for his child today, a console for the TV and a game, his son is sitting in control of the console-hero of the game, that hero steals cars, beats and kills people. The game is written on the disc that for + 18 years, the child is 10.5 years old. The son says that all boys in their class know and play this toy. In Russia, boys at this age also play this game?\n",
      "It turned out that my son had indeed decided to keep the promise he had made to the priest. Maybe now I will use it every time, every time I go to the catechism for my child, meet this priest there and ask the priest to ask his son to do what he did, for example, wash dishes....\n",
      "My son becomes as fanatical a Catholic as his dad, but he is never greedy. And very calm and pacifist, in school life, he was not complained about for fighting, so lies.\n",
      "And what is the relationship between grades and the fact that moms run to negotiate with teachers? What do they run to negotiate? Good grades? They bribe teachers for this? Personally, I have everything simple - the eldest son almost always got average or bad grades Now the youngest son always gets excellent and good grades.\n",
      "Strangely enough, yes. In some cases. Both my sons hated going to music at first. Well, when the first thing started was a boring solfedjo, boring ranges and still not being able to sit down and play a melody, not being able to feel and metricize A keys, I was forced to go to a music school. The eldest is not a musician, but he has an electronic piano at home and now sits on his own sheet music and teaches himself something. The last time he played Mozart's Turkish March to me - in an unforgiving arrangement, in a fast rhythm. Yes, now it's a pleasure for him to sit down at his piano and play.\n",
      "I would immediately run up and hit my grandmother in the face with the same mitten. And I would call the first police, from my cell phone. I would call the police, because my grandmother would probably try to fight me later, so I would call the police first.\n",
      "Happy parents of about 11-year-olds (+ -) Which books are most definitely for this age - unquestionably attractive, so that you want to read to the end. What do your children read at this age? Conan Doyle or Agatha Christie, Stephen King fit?\n",
      "Do you think seriously about all this? Do you think there are only two extremes - on the one hand, a church, and on the other, a drug addict? The vast majority of children grow up without a church and drugs. Would you agree that your son, if you have one, should become a priest and never marry? Catholics have this. How can a priest live a normal life at all. I don't know about a good and stable job. I have no idea who pays them a salary, the Pope, or whatever.\n",
      "+ For me, a full-fledged life means having a family and children. And Catholic priests are not allowed to marry at all.\n",
      "Yes, of course. Yesterday, there was a scandal when they returned with their husband and he announced it. Naturally, his son says that he does not want to be a priest. He does not yet understand very much about women, as long as he says that he never marries and that girls are not interesting to him at all.\n",
      "No, the pope certainly would not like his son to become a priest, but to serve at mass - why not.\n",
      "Alas. That is the case. Sometimes we have long conversations with my son and I justify my atheism to him. But he has already penetrated very deeply into his consciousness and subconscious.\n",
      "And how do you know that I didn't \"sort it out\" I also decided to enroll my son in a catechism of carvings for the development of his general culture (almost all classical painting is on biblical subjects)\n",
      "The son is 11 years old. Communicates more with his father. And now he goes to college, leaves in the morning, returns at 6 p.m. Information about how the day passed should be pulled with pliers. It's the same with music. He plays some stupid GTM, his husband at least understands something there. And I'm nothing at all. Sometimes I ask him to let's just talk about anything. Then we talk about a variety of topics (only about his school life he is silent like a guerrilla).\n",
      "There is physical education, but there are no movies. It is the subjects, one after the other. Sometimes the educational process is interrupted by one event, for example, on Monday my son's class goes to the Louvre in Paris.\n",
      "If my son was an outcast in the classroom and there were no friends, I would definitely transfer him to another school. No matter whether he studies well or badly. At this age, ostracism is very traumatic. Therefore, there is no motivation to study, and there is no mountain of complexes in the future.\n",
      "I had one son at 21 and another at 42. From the height of my life, I advise young mothers to have two children, so that the difference is small. I agree, the first - second year of the birth of the second will be hell. But then everything will come back.\n",
      "Why would I not hang out with him???? You read the very first sentence????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n",
      "They would have punished both of them in my case, without murmuring evil. Well, yes, I will talk to J's parents if I see them by chance. I will tell them that J is not to blame for the fight, and that I even welcome the fact that she responded to the aggression.I will ask them to influence my daughter, because it is not easy to tell K. about life.\n",
      "The second answer to the first question. The headmaster is aware of it. I told him everything the same day - he shrugged sympathetically and said that it was difficult for all Kimberly's students.\n",
      "Move your son's attention to something else, author. My son is almost 12, it is clear that he knows where the children come from, but to talk or show him the sex of the act in the picture and generally delve into this topic - I will never be able in my life and my son will also not be able and will not want to talk about IMHO in such detail with the children is not healthy.\n",
      "The author, I did not study especially, neither with the elder nor with the younger. But they grew up quite differently. The elder studied poorly, the younger - excellent and developed perfectly on his own, was always inquisitive.\n",
      "But in the same lyceum, my son's classmate wanted to gouge out his eye with a hook for fine hair dye. But she got into his ear and pierced it through. But there, the hook at the end.\n",
      "Author, my son is now 12 years old. Horror. I don't know how to react. I have forgotten what happened to the eldest at that age, it was too long ago.\n",
      "I am not afraid of anything. Our sons were very disappointed that they are not in the same class. And the boy's parents and I made sure that this boy was transferred to our class. Both children are terribly happy. Do you not see anything positive in this? Your child probably does not have one real friend in school. I genuinely feel sorry for the children in such situations.\n",
      "We have no idea why. Probably, they choose the lotus. We still had a role in choosing the Latin language so raw from it, and did not refuse it even after being transferred to it in the class of a comrade.\n",
      "What \"school\"? I explained that in France, primary schools, middle schools and high schools are different educational institutions. They are located in different buildings and geographic points. After one scandal in each institution, we have no more problems with the administrations. My son has absolutely nothing to fight for, he is studying perfectly, there have never been any problems with discipline.\n",
      "Why would you want to show something here? Smart people will take my word for it, and I have absolutely nothing to make up such a story. I have nothing to prove to fools. And everything is written there by hand, by my son, in French. Nice people (who are really non-anonymous and kind), if you will, I will tell you something interesting about my eldest son's life.\n",
      "My son is a brilliant student. He never had any problems with dtdiscipline. His friend confirmed absolutely everything. + The teacher had the folly to dictate all this to the students to write it down in their notebooks.\n",
      "The teacher had to explain to the children the basic tenets and histories of the world's fragmented religions - Christianity, Islam, Buddhism. Well, paganism remains somewhere. But he told only about Islam. Today, his son said that this is the homework he gave to the children. Find 3 examples on the Internet that show and prove that Islam is the religion that brought more to the world than other religions.\n",
      "Again, I don't know how other parents would feel if the children came home and told them all? Maybe they wrote a complaint to the authorities or went to the police.\n",
      "No. I do not accept that Islam has brought much more to world culture than other religions, and PRINES has brought more culture than other religions. I have seen my son's notebook, where the phrase is written in black and white.\n",
      "This is not a reason to protect my son specifically... He does not have to be protected at all. Such information will not harm his worldview in any way. Because he is very intelligent and can analyze and select information himself. But it smacks of recruiting children to Islamism. Daesh are not fools at all. They are cunning, and it may well be that such things are taking place in such peaceful institutions as my son's college, in institutions that no one can think of involving children in Islam.\n",
      "Well, yes. I wrote last time that on Mondays I pick them up in the car with my son from college, they finish their lessons before the school bus.\n",
      "And my friend, who is the father of a classmate, went to the police yesterday morning, too, and his daughter told him and showed him the same thing. It's funny that he went to another police station, we have to file a complaint here, and he lives in another place. And Aksel's mother believed and also (with a notebook) decided to go to the police - to the same police station as I did.\n",
      "No, it was I who suggested here why, despite the obvious outrage of what happened in the lesson, many people suddenly started blaming me and my son. I think because of the photo and the fact that we manage to show the World to our child right now. I don't see any other reason.\n",
      "Who are the \"gathering of idiots\"? All the students in the class, except the teacher? My son and his friend? My son, his friend, his classmate, me, Axel's parents and the father of the classmate? Who exactly is the \"gathering of idiots\"? The word \"gathering\" implies a plural face, that is, I am not the only one. If you mean me and my son, two people cannot be a \"gathering,\" either.\n",
      "Did you see what was written in my son's notebook under his dictation? Worst of all, he spoke very disrespectfully and negatively about the Catholic religion.\n",
      "I agree with everything you wrote. My husband tried to turn his youngest son into a Catholic fanatic.\n",
      "In which prayers? In my son's notebook, some Muslim prayer in French, written according to the teacher's dictation, is short. There is one solid piece of wood there. And the children MUST learn it by heart - it is such homework.\n",
      "Right! My son has not absorbed all the nuances of living in a big city since he was a child, and it is, of course, impossible to say that he knows Paris well.\n",
      "U nas v derevne nikekie porutchenia nevozmogni Vokrug- priroda Do bligaichego magazina nado ehat na machineTak chto on poka nikaki takie poruthenis ne vipolnial i ia ne znau sklonen on ili netDoma i v sadu vsie moi prosby ispolniaet A ezdit inogda proguliatsia v Paris eto odnomu estesvenno budet lutche I interesnee i bezopasnee s drugom!!!!!!!\n",
      "He is capable. If he has problems in college, he goes to the teacher's office, to the head teacher and explains everything to him on his own initiative. I don't think that my son would have attracted the attention of the police in the streets of Paris. It is if the child is lost and alone, then the adults around him will help him.\n",
      "My granddaughter studied ballet when she lived in France, and my son often took her to ballet, and to good performances, in Paris - and always took my youngest son. My son has never been to drama theatres. I do not like them myself. But he loves music very much, and at least twice a month we go to concerts in Paris - either to some philharmonic hall, or to free concerts, often such as organ concerts, take place in churches, including Notre Dame. There are even programs of such free concerts on the Internet.\n",
      "It is impossible to counterfeit shoes. Clothing can be very qualitatively counterfeited (such counterfeit and costs more) I even write the word brand nasty. I do not know which brands. My sons both love clothes, so that it was very unobtrusively written ugo boss. On my last trip to this type of country (where counterfeits are made), I bought the eldest a very long scarf, the mark ugo boss on it is worth it, he is happy.\n",
      "Yes. I have heard that a new \"European\" lyceum has been built in a very small town (about 40 km), so we will find out more about it and praise it. In this case, of course, I will take my son there and bring him there every day.\n",
      "Have you forgotten your mortgage, insurance, heating, taxes, and so on? My son's blue dream is to study there, to pay 8,000 euros a year for 5 years, and also to pay for a house near this university, and so on. On my husband's salary alone, we cannot do that, because the mortgage on the house will not have been finally repaid by that time.\n",
      "The boy is 12 years old. He has already decided definitively that he will be an engineer in the field of aeronaphtics. He is an excellent student in physics and mathematics, but such a university costs (only training) 8 thousand euros a year.\n",
      "No, I can't ask for it, she has a frantic rhythm of life. I've been with her son and my husband has been, so basically my husband knows how to get there by subway.\n",
      "AUTOR Don't want your daughter to drop out of school. My two sons went the first 4 years too reluctantly. But then, when you can quickly sort the notes out and play fluently, it's a HUGE joy and a plus for life.\n",
      "My son did brilliantly in the second cycle! That is to say, he was among the 20 per cent who passed this exam - these are students from municipal conservatories in many cities of our department. And the scandal is directly related to this exam.\n",
      "Hello! All dreams can be explained by Freud, but it needs to go very far into the subconscious. Always all dreams are connected with your own life and in the dream you make an association. I take my son to Paris often, very often.\n",
      "Maybe that's why my son doesn't complain, knowing what a scandalous character I am. He always says that everything is fine in college. Actually, I don't even know if it's true. Most likely, there are some minor conflicts, but he doesn't tell me, he's afraid I'll run to the headmaster and ring the bells. (My child has never been an aggressor if anything.)\n",
      "In the summer we will go on a trip to Ukraine - China - Vietnam.

      "An example from our family is the exception to the rule. My son is very inquisitive, wants to know everything.\n",
      "+ I agree that it is necessary to talk to a child about all topics, including current world events (wars, revolutions) - what is being talked about in the current time (any) on TV news. It is necessary that the child is interested in himself globally, and how he functions - the world and our life in it and has learned to look at life broadly. But my husband has deliberately made an idol of himself for our youngest.\n",
      "The younger son is cleverer than the man. No, we have peaceful rallies. The last time the war in France was in 2006, when the Arabs (ONLY the Arabs roared at buildings, cars, and so on.\n",
      "Well, what about the large crowd of people, it's clear, the crowd, what's dangerous, that they can advise not to go, but look at this. If in Russia a student brings such a newspaper - propitovoputinsky authorized rally and he is on the front page with the organizer of the rally and he will show this newspaper to everyone in school, teachers will say something to him, will he do soaking? How about here, my son and the organizer of the rally and a big headline about the anti-macro rally? + picard + ruffin + federe + des + anti + macrons & oq = courrier + picard + ruffin + federe + des + anti + macrons & gs _ l = img.3... 54378.670.0.68514.17.17.0.0.0.162.04.15j2.17.0.... 0... 1c.1.\n",
      "Letters to all authorities. Possibly to the court against the school. Your boy is still young, he has a lot of life ahead of him. Protect him while he is a child. It's not just bruises. It's psychological stress. The child should feel protected.2 vs. 1 is terrible and despicable.\n",
      "My son (junior) started! He started to learn this, in a genuine (not easy) arrangement. It's not a music school, it's up to him. I told him that when he learns to play it, we'll buy him a dog.\n",
      "Yes, I feel sorry for working teenagers, but I am against it.\n",
      "Well, yes. That's why I made this top. The question is that my son is saintly sure that at exactly 14 years old we will buy him a scooter, his husband does EVERYTHING his son wants, and I am against it. That's why I asked the opinions of people here.\n",
      "It seems that every teacher thinks that his or her subject is the only one. Today, I had tests in history, French, Spanish, and Latin. When I was teaching in high school and planning tests, I always conspired with my students on what day was right for them, whether there were any other tests on the same day not to load them up.\n",
      "Yes, you are crazy. From our house to the left is our district center 8 km and right is my son's college 8 km. Of course, he goes there either by school bus or I drive by car. On foot he walks 600 meters to our town hall, where the school bus stops.\n",
      "That's not the point. I had my first son who didn't do well at school and didn't have any girls or romantic teenage relationships at all, I didn't even start a relationship. It ended very dramatically for us and for him. I brought the first one I slept with into the house, I suspect, on the first day I met him, he wasn't 17 yet, married her, had a child.\n",
      "We have a 13-year-old son. We have been discussing politics, elections, and so on at an adult level for a long time. That is, the son is mature enough to have discussions with us, at our adult level. Arnumber, Analyze. Write how old you have been discussing politics with your children.\n",
      "When we have guests, we always talk about this or that topic around the table. An adult topic, a political topic, anything. My son is not silent, he participates in the conversation at the same level as adults.\n",
      "Of course, in music school. Solfegio and improvisation they do in groups, the Instrument - one-on-one with the teacher, he is there in the video, too, a grey-haired man of such small stature, at first when my son sits at the piano. My son plays better at home, but here he was very worried.\n",
      "Not true. I myself shoot my son for a photo shoot, so I can't be in this video a priori. My husband flashes there, teacher Dana flashes too, other teachers flash, the headmaster of the fly school flashes the mayor of the city and his various cameras flash, my Russian friend (she lives in a village nearby and her daughter-flickers a lot of publicity too) flashes.\n",
      "And why did all these people gather in the town hall, in the hall for ceremonies in our city, everyone listens to it and applaud at the end? Really out of pity? But when we flew to Asia this summer, my son also played the piano - at Charles de Gaulle airport. Our gate had a red piano so that people could have fun, who knows how to play while waiting to land. There even the notes were fixed, a few pieces. My son played a lot there and a circle of spectators formed around him - passengers listened to him and clapped.\n",
      "Cool! Is your boy talking? Excellent he says, excellent pronunciation (I'm a long way from that pronunciation) There is much more to Harry Potter than commenting on how to cook an omelette.\n",
      "No, the first one is also a boy. But there's another drama there. He was very close to me until he was 16 and a half years old, and then he just disappeared from my life (our life I mean) And now I'm just sure that if the second child were a girl, we would be best friends, like me and my mum.\n",
      "Not that I am not ready. I do not know such physiological details about the teenager's son and I cannot know. But he is certainly not interested in girls at all, not that sex. He is still a child in this respect, at the age of 14, it is early for children to be interested in sex.\n",
      "When friends or girlfriends come to us, how does it usually happen? We always do that. My son prepares hot chocolate and something tasty. He eats in the kitchen, it's warm now, we went to the garden. Then I have to vacate the showroom for them, because my friend and I play the piano together a lot, and it stands there. So they hardly go upstairs to my son's room. I try not to disturb them, I always go to another room.\n",
      "My friend has a daughter a year older than her son. Summer holidays are also in Canada. We have camps, but no, mine won't want to go there. Not a week with a class on the sea or in the mountains or in any European city is great, the municipality runs the camps. If only in a theme camp, for example, where equestrian training is taught, but mine wants to be self-sufficient, and in the camps they are watched by animators and you can't do what you want.\n",
      "I am an author, I am 160, my husband is 173. The oldest son is an adult already-180, the youngest, in May will be 14 years old, almost the same height as my husband, but I am as afraid as you are. I want at least to grow up as the eldest.\n",
      "What would you give to the bus with yourself. The program is composed by people who I suspect have never traveled 16 hours on a bus in their lives. We are even after 10 hours on a plane (and it is still possible to get up and go - when we arrive, the first thing is to get at least 3 hours of comfortable sleep. And then it is assumed that they will sleep on a bus at night.\n",
      "But you rejoice that you, 30 years old, have passed away to a 50-year-old, not a 19-year-old! Their union will not last long if he, like you, is 30 years old. Imagine in 20 years... what a 50-year-old he will be!\n",
      "You are what you are. Don't rape yourself. You have a full-fledged family. Even if you don't do much with your children, it's good for them, because they have a mother and a full-fledged family. Do you think they haven't achieved something there? It's not true. You've had children. I don't understand about work at all, because I don't work at all. And then life will still change, the children will grow up, with them it will be more interesting. And then there will be grandchildren.\n",
      "To live in a city and have a dacha is fine. Think of people who will never buy a dacha in their lives. Well, it can be built for years until their son grows up or whatever. Land and a dacha will not go away.\n",
      "Because it will be clear to everyone how sad and lonely she is and that she doesn't have a man and that she went out in the hope of getting to know someone.\n",
      "I absolutely agree that spiritual inner closeness with a child in childhood and adolescence is not a guarantee that it will remain so. No, morning, just as I had - fortunately, we meet very rarely. Yes, we are a family, outwardly we communicate and everything is fine. But it is impossible to erase from the memory drive the fact that your own son has committed a despicable act. And we have to live with this knowledge.\n",
      "Angry, outraged and upset by the anonymity - which then erupted in a rant about late children - I will show you a picture where I am with my sons and granddaughter. Can this picture calm you? 3648x2736 (688.11 kB) www.fotolink.su\n",

What is the horror of having such a granddaughter and yet such a son who is younger than his granddaughter? 3648x2736 (753.15 kB) www.fotolink.su\n",
      "I am a 52-year-old mother. I have a 30-year-old son, a 12-and-a-half-year-old daughter, and we also have a second son, 11 years old. Here I am with my two sons and granddaughter a year ago. Click on the photo 3 times to enlarge the screen 3648x2736 (734.77 kB) www.fotolink.su\n",
      "Personally, I HAPPENED both of my sons constantly until about a year old - then they learned to walk by themselves.\n",
      "Ah about that.... Well, my sons eat. And the French like it when they are served. And in general, buckwheat is sold here, in supermarkets, only in the form of flour - to make pancakes with a salty filling.\n",
      "Countries like the United States, for example, or Malaysia, Thailand, Cuba, India, Qatar - where we began to take our second son on summer holidays - are not, there are no crowds there. Countries are big, expensive, places are plentiful and crowds have never seen a place, and local vacations are usually not in summer, except in the United States.\n",
      "Yes. But we have one adult son, and he doesn't travel with us. So the three of us go. Everything has become more expensive, yes. I don't work, my husband's vacation is always a month in the summer.\n",
      "Because, let's say, we gave birth to our first son early and by the age of 41 we became grandparents. But the prospect of only living together was terrifying. So we started a new life.\n",
      "I would go unequivocally. Only with my child. At 12! To Mexico! Make him so happy. We went to China with our eldest son in the middle of the school year, though for 10 days. He was in high school and I told the teacher the truth that there was an opportunity to go to China and that it would be very informative for my son, the lyceum didn't object.\n",
      "My son sometimes asks to go to Paris with his father for work. Several times they did so (during school holidays) My husband has a separate office and of course no one can be there. Usually it is on a slightly busy working day, the son takes his homework there, dines in the restaurant of the company with his father and before returning home they still manage to go to some museum www.fotolink.su\n",
      "Why should he flee somewhere? He and I get along very well, understanding each other without words, and by sight, on the same wave, supporting each other. We talk about all the topics in the world, laugh with one joke, travel together, have already traveled half the world, and, most importantly, we have two sons. Our union is unbreakable, it is a fortress. We have one of the most terrible points of disagreement - politics. Well, I am a categorical atheist, and he has made my son a Catholic believer and he categorically does not accept my position of choosing not to live.\n",
      "If not, there is no trial, and if so, offer to buy a new phone for the girl, paying half each.\n",
      "My son is 20 years old? And it still depends on you whether you \"send\" him abroad or not? You are extremely lucky, author, that this is the question at all. I married at 18 years old, and a year and a half before I brought my girlfriend to us to live on permanent residence. They described the situation in such a way that either we take her or she stays on the street. That is, while she lived with us - then entirely at our expense, the son had no money, but it was not scary. And then there was a drama of our life because of all this.\n",
      "My eldest when I was married and his wife was pregnant. My husband and I understood that we could not live without children and gave birth to another. We now live a second life.\n",
      "I can't. I have a husband and sons, one of whom is 11 years old. I have no right to hurt them. That's why I rejoice that I am becoming less and less natural. If I had been alone, I would have been gone a long time ago.\n",
      "I became a grandmother at 40, and a mother for the second time at 42. Naturally, I love my second son more than my granddaughter. My granddaughter is older than my second son.\n",
      "I can't believe that if my son was jailed, a man came and wrote it on Eve, even anonymously. When I saw the name, I thought it was Margulies who was finally caught and jailed for larceny for 15 years. I thought maybe there in Estonia, in turbans, you can use the Internet for 15 minutes every 3 months.\n",
      "The author does not use the word \"start\" for children. \"Start\" is a dog. On the subject, I would give birth to a second. My youngest son constantly asks for a brother or sister, but it is too late.\n",
      "And I have my youngest (11 years old) buzzing that he wants another younger brother or sister (there is an older brother, but he is already 33 years old...) I tell him that in a few years you will have your own children.\n",
      "Author, I don't think I can bring up anything. It's a native property of the character - a podkarshnik or not. Here is my eldest son, a real podkarshnik, I hope that the younger one won't!\n",
      "I don't understand it. How can I not be able to live normally because of the presence of my own son at home. I am 33 years old, If something happens in his life that he will have nowhere to live (or just if he tells me that he wants to come back to live with us) - and even if he is married and with a child - my husband and I will not even have a hint of denying him. He is our son.\n",
      "It doesn't matter how old my son is, even a hundred years old. He's MY Son. It wouldn't be fatal to our standard of living. I wouldn't even talk about it at all. Every week we do grocery shopping, just buy more. If he wanted to buy something himself, he would buy something.\n",
      "Do you work, have three children with him... at this rate, why should YOU clean? Equitably you have to do your homework. The author, personally, I don't work very much, I have given birth to two sons, so I don't even cook almost sama- my husband cooks at weekends and evenings after work and does his homework with my son. I clean mostly, yes, but even if sometimes I don't clean, he never comments to me in my life.\n",
      "What if the boy's father didn't work or study, but got all these millions from heaven, his American uncle died? No, I personally wouldn't hate such acquaintances, but certainly I won't consider catalogues with yachts with them.\n",
      "Well, we have a driver's license - it's expensive here (driving school and croquettes are expensive) - but it's normal that parents pay for it. If he wants to own his own car later, we'll buy some used car. And so on.\n",
      "What a happy mother you are. I have one son who is 32 years old and another who is 11 and a half years old. The eldest never helped me with the youngest. I was always helping them with their daughter, my granddaughter.\n",
      "I have worked all my life very rarely, sporadically. Good interesting work. Even traveling is not so interesting now, because I was almost everywhere. The eldest son has been an uncle for a long time. There is no purpose, House, garden, roses, etc. I read books all the time, and I have always disliked theatres and exhibitions and museums.\n",
      "My son is 32 years old. He is divorced. He works. Like you said, he has a job - everyone is already married or settled down. At his age, he doesn't go to a discotheque. And don't sit down with women in cafes. The NHS in France, as in Russia, is what I was told and logically and theoretically - very rarely is anyone really helped to find a mate.\n",
      "For the same reason, I never went to the gynaecologist again in my life. I was so traumatized to the subconscious level by this torture (the labour process). But at 42 I gave birth to my second, already under an epidural, and now I regret that I did not give birth earlier.\n",
      "No. My husband needed this shock therapy to start treating his wife more attentively. No one there will die of anxiety. Because the author did not go missing, but made it clear on Tuesday morning. What son are you talking about? If my eldest had told me that, I would have been absolutely calm, he is 32 years old. If the youngest had said that, he is not 12 yet, I would have gone crazy.\n",
      "Sitting with them for 3 days was \"blowing up\"? My son and ex-daughter-in-law knew that I was ready to sit with my granddaughter whenever and wherever they needed it. For me, it was always a joy, not a distraction.\n",
      "Well, if you had one, I sympathize with you and your son. It's not unpleasant for you to call your own son a nozzle, etc.? This is his trouble. Everyone is different. I also have 2 sons, none of whom were as you described, the children go to kindergarten for a week, and at weekends there is a husband who can have a great time with the child if he wants a bright life.\n",
      "Author, such a problem is not only for mothers of daughters, notes and mothers of sons, I assure you! Exactly the same problem and exactly the same fear that one will remain.\n",
      "I don't know how normal it is. If such a situation had happened in our family before the divorce of our eldest son, my husband and I would, of course, have paid for our vacation ourselves, and the young would have been let go wherever and whenever they wanted, and would have stayed with our granddaughter.\n",
      "The author, not everyone lives this way. We have only a husband working (my work at school does not count) I do nothing. My youngest son will soon be 12 years old.\n",
      "After that life goes on, even the second son gave birth, but life at a speed of 200 km / h is over. Bright emotions and desires are over (all have already been fulfilled), everything has become uninteresting because ALL was known until the age of 40.\n",
      "It was a long time ago and the story is very complicated, for me and my husband it is tragic. I don't want to lose all this again in my head. In short, you live happily with a very close family, you are a husband and the only beloved son. He married very early. And you are already expecting a granddaughter. And in a moment everything is interrupted, the son disappears from your life and you live for about a year and a half without knowing anything about him. Even if he is still alive.\n",
      "And how can you judge a man from the photos - as a man (leaving aside my sons, old men, little boys, and priest) - and as a person (everyone is good)?\n",
      "This curfew lasted for about a month. In troubled places of hooliganism, parents themselves will not let the child go alone at night. But there is no such thing as it is forbidden by law or some other regulation - there is no such thing. Curfews are a measure of military time.\n",
      "Everything is done, I have enough clothes for another 10 lives. I looked at the world in such a way that I already have nowhere to go. We bought a house, with a garden - it was always my great dream. So when, due to my husband's retirement and in connection with the universal crisis, our purchasing power will drop somewhat, I think, it will not be scary. Personally for me. I don't need anything more at all.\n",
      "Author, it is strange that your son at the age of 14 (when he already understands and knows everything) is so untactful that, even if he sees something there, he starts asking you what it is. Of course, it is not good to leave such traces, but to talk about it with your mother is imho, it is simply not tactful on your son's part.\n",
      "I had this feeling all of a sudden and firmly at the age of 50. Since then, every other person has brought me nothing but joy. Before that, birthdays were very sad.\n",
      "I was married, divorced, and my daughter, of course, stayed with my mother, and before she left for Vietnam, the truth is that from next year she will return to France to live with her father. He rents an apartment. He works at a stable decent job, but it is impossible to have a special career there. The car is there, in the end. He doesn't talk much about his personal life. I don't even know if he has a woman or not.\n",
      "If you want to tell us what kind of joke we made for our eldest son yesterday, please tell us whether we had really original and funny April 1 jokes in your direction or from your side.\n",
      "This is when I said I was congratulating my son on April 1 and he immediately realized what a terrible nightmare he had avoided! Probably, he was dancing with joy. I would be happy to tell interesting stories from my life and show my beautiful outfits, too, but on this forum I am no longer allowed to do it, unfortunately ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((\n",
      "It's a very long story and I can't scroll through it again in my head. I then, if I survived, almost died thanks to Prozac, weighed 44 kg. Here some people know this story. He's very closed, it's impossible to talk to him deeply and frankly. After all, after what he did, he probably has a guilt complex in his mind and we won't have any honest and deep conversation with him.\n",
      "The author you broke my record. I became a grandmother at 40 years of age. But then, at 42, I gave birth to my second son myself. Now my granddaughter is almost 15, and my second son is 13.\n",
      "Author, 300 years ago my son told me much the same thing, but he was still in high school and he was 17 years old. My husband and I immediately agreed and accepted my daughter-in-law into the family as a daughter. I said that I didn't work anyway, so until they got on their feet, they would live and eat with us free of charge, if my daughter-in-law went to work or study, I would sit with my granddaughter.\n",
      "No, there are no other close friends, this classmate is the closest one. The rest are just friends and acquaintances - in chess club and music. How do you know whether or not this boy's parents allow him to show his photos? His parents and I are friends too... Do you call all the children wearing glasses glasses?\n",
      "Right? One finger? Did you look closely? That's when Mozart's \"Turkish March\" was small, and now the youngest is playing times better than my eldest son.\n",
      "Logically speaking, it is better not to give birth to anyone at all, because life is not a gift to anyone in principle. Personally, I gave birth to two sons. The maternal instinct is the strongest, yes, everyone has it. But if you look deeper, having a child is the most terrible selfishness, because personally I would prefer not to be born if I were asked about it before I was born. So, the maternal instinct and creating a purpose for my own life.\n",
      "No. We laugh a lot. I wrote what childbirth means to me in principle. I am really happy that I have 2 sons. And, then, this is my personal point of view, because I deeply and analytically do not like Life. My husband does not agree with me, my eldest son thinks a little like me, and we have not yet talked about such topics with the youngest. I do not want to instill in him an aversion to life, to what sits within me. That is why I do not touch on this area.\n",
      "And I know exactly what I will be in my old age, because I have already lived to it - to my old age Here I am, which in my old age I will no longer be.\n",
      "My husband and eldest son know my philosophy. They just know we don't talk about it at home at all, their opinion on life is the opposite. I have absolutely no fear of dying.\n",
      "Author, this woman is the mother of your grandson - she lives alone or is married to someone she has already married? I would be in your place if I suddenly saw such a thing, I would approach her, get to know her, explain everything and start to communicate closely - if she agreed, of course.\n",
      "Author, we were all born into this life - as punishment for our sins in some past lives, Now we are all living in hell. Otherwise, imho life is impossible to call. And so it is for everyone, but most probably do not realize it. I, too, am sick of waking up every morning and knowing that I will have to live another day.\n",
      "I have a slightly different situation. My husband is adventurous and has nothing against travelling to the end of the world on his own. But he works and has a vacation with him once a year. This time of year, we go on an adventurous independent trip, + with our youngest son. And I don't work, that is, I have time in bulk.\n",
      "It is possible, yes. That a person at 79 turns out to be physically stronger than a person at 46. What in this family does a grandmother physically do more than the author? Drives a girl to school. (This moment is not very clear to me, maybe the area is cremated.) That's all.\n",
      "The only thing we could do was give less to the eldest, because when he was a child we were poorer than we are now and he was not lucky enough to live in his own home from childhood.\n",
      "I would give most of it to my sons, the oldest now, the youngest, and put it into his account. Then I would get rid of some loans. Everything else would go into cosmetic surgery.\n",
      "I will say from the other side of the barricades. I have sons, but unambiguously, if sons get married and spend all their time with grandchildren, and so on, not with us, but with the parents of their wives, I will be very bitter.\n",
      "My eldest son can help anyone. The youngest is not yet 14 years old, so he can't help. And my husband won't help anyone either. And if I help financially, simply because I am a very charismatic man who is also someone's husband, I don't have a shred of remorse.\n",
      "Yes. My father is half Ukrainian. But I have never lived there in my life. He has lived in St. Petersburg all his life and cannot speak Ukrainian himself. And the source of \"small\" is not from there at all.\n",
      "We have a non-working day today (the end of World War I) so my husband is at home and my son is at home. We all do nothing in the morning, we are reluctant to go outside, it is cold and uncomfortable there.\n",
      "Look for the same name that signed the letter about medicinal herbs in the first link. Look in the recipe area for cat lovers as well, how to care for them.\n",
      "And here's where everyone in the clip has unnatural and depressive smiles, or just me? Absolutely all of my husband's relatives and my eldest son (he is Indian) have depression?\n",
      "And if you are afraid of the army and therefore he will go as a foreigner, how are you not afraid that even if he is issued an INTERNAL Russian passport, with a specific address, with a residence permit (though not an official residence permit. They do not issue an internal Russian passport to foreigners), he will be buried at the military enlistment office the next day?\n",
      "Why? My son is not lying. But if an aunt invites other children - all of them - to take revenge on her son and his comrades, because she punished everyone because of them, it is very despicable and unfair on the part of the aunt.\n",
      "My son will never be so rude to an adult in his life, because he is polite and he is not a fool. To say that to adults is unacceptable. And if he had said that, we would not have defended him. But I have taught him one basic rule: he must be confident and be UNCORINATELY polite - in any conflict.\n",
      "Wheel, thank you (thanks to all the non-malevolent here) Well, the son told and laughed. I am glad that his sense of humor is combined with the wisdom that we teach him.\n",
      "I forgot to add that we also got in touch by phone with three parents of my son's friends who were involved in this story. Two mothers said that they had also written complaints to the mayor's office, and one said that she would go to the mayor's office for an appointment.\n",
      "And the woman on the right is one of the mothers of the other boys who suffered, she lives in my village and is a friend of mine. She will go personally to the mayor with a complaint against that woman3648x2736 (728.69 kB) www.fotolink.su\n",
      "So to ask someone to be beaten in the muzzle as your mother asked for it for you - I have no reason. And the fact that my son and his friends tell how they are treated by an EIGHT person is not a knock. Because an angry person has a big advantage over a child - status, adulthood, authority, power. And if an adult pits children against one another to beat my child - I will make that adult very bad.\n",
      "No. My son is truth--too smart and too good-natured to pack up. Of course, you may not believe me, you don't know him. I would never defend him in my life if I doubted for a second that he was telling the truth.\n",
      "I don't know Pepe about your story. I would never give advice as your mother - to put in my son's muzzle if he is ugly. Or for such a son to be a completely uncontrollable aggressive future criminal. Have you been that way when you were a child? But then it is impossible to enroll such a person in a regular school, but in some special one. All the people who read me here can only believe me on a word about the absolute peacefulness of my son. Naturally, how can they know if they don't know him personally.\n",
      "Apart from two or three normal and nice people, they took the opportunity to talk about my son (but knowing in advance about this possibility, I made sure that it didn't affect him and came back. I know how to do it). I'm in a different mood from the episode, so I told them. Why not ask about the outfit here at the same time?\n",
      "If the mayor does not answer us about what sanction the employee will receive and if within a few days she does something else perfidious and evil towards my son (henceforth I have called him to impeccable discipline and not to tell her anything more) - yes, we are writing a letter to the prosecutor with a complaint against her specifically and against her superiors, those against the mayor.\n",
      "Well, we are so divided. Even the canteen itself is located not on the school grounds, but next to it. Hot dinners are brought to the canteen, which are made in the central kitchen in our district center, and portions are served in barkets. Well, in the canteen, these women work, serving tables and keeping order. This one is attached to her son. Relations with others are normal. All the affairs of the school canteen are run exclusively by the mayor's office, the school has nothing to do with it. It will just be long and boring to tell all the preceding ingredients from the beginning of the year.\n",
      "The wheel is not coarse. One of the rare people on Eve k who can be called human. Please call the coarse people who write nasty things about my 10-year-old son here.\n",
      "So where is the link? Where do you see that the author is insulting the son of Spring? Just don't start the bagpipes again because it was anonymous, but everyone knows who I am. I, too, can collect anonymous dirty references and shout that this or that was written by this or that. And everyone knows. I just showed you the evidence that spring is specifically covering my son. And I didn't want to dig into it because I don't think about it anymore and in general I don't want bad for Spring.\n",
      "Because there are NO such references. Everything you write is a lie. Because if my son were a DTsPshnik and a thick-muzzled, I would never write such a thing about my son in my life. No mother would write such a thing about her son. To find my post like this if it were easier - in a search engine - to write my nickname, her nickname and the relevant words. I have just proved to you and showed you concrete insults from a specific nickname to my child. YOU have not proven anything, but said lies from yourself, by your words.\n",
      "In families where both foreign parents and at home speak their mother tongue, the children are bilingual automatically. My husband and I speak only French, so it is easier. The oldest was very often in Russia, the youngest never. But everything I wrote does not absolve me of the guilt, which I feel acutely.\n",
      "The fact that I \"slept\" with him was originally invented by Margulies, and then people like you got caught.\n",
      "I did not understand anything from what you wrote. My son goes to this dining room and is constantly stressed by this woman. The woman called on all the children to harass my son and his buddies on the change and gave me the green light to do so. If you do nothing for your son in this case, it is your system of relations within the family. I will not allow anyone, ever, to abuse my child (to any extent).\n",
      "And my son does not understand insults. I will never teach him to understand insults, but the right way to react and answer them is what I teach him. Not to respond to insults with insults.\n",
      "So right now, my son is in school and we need to protect him. So that he understands that he has a reliable rear. Teach him to defend himself, but first be with him. Because a child in school will never be able to resist the power of any adult or, for example, a group of children if he is bullied. If you do not support him, everything will only deepen.\n",
      "But my son also explains my point of view on this question, and here, in his early years, he thinks better than his father about what to do.\n",
      "The author and I have a son of the same age. He would probably love to go on an expensive trip to the end of the world with me, but if I paid for it. Since he left the family to live on his own, he no longer travels with us to different countries and is now jealous of his younger brother, whom we now take everywhere!\n",
      "Grandfather in the Great Patriotic War held a high position in the army, and after the war his family was given an excellent large three-bedroom apartment in Leningrad, and my mother later privatized it.\n",

      "Well, yes, I mean that as soon as I gave birth to my youngest at 42, I would have agreed to go through the menopause and get a lot of money if there had been a choice.\n",
      "And the youngest also gave, he was in Brittany for just a week with a class and bought all sorts of souvenirs and chocolates there.\n",
      "Well, yes. Mother's Day and Father's Day are European holidays. They always fall on a Sunday, but nobody here knows or knows that March 8 is a women's holiday.\n",
      "In the years of stagnation, when they left for permanent residence, only Jews who left for Israel were deprived of their citizenship. And no one deprived women who left there of their citizenship, although their internal passport was confiscated at the time. And they excluded them from the Komsomol ((((((((((((I change my Russian foreign passport periodically at our embassy. My eldest son also obtained Russian citizenship at the embassy, and my youngest son also has Russian citizenship, although he has never been there in his life.\n",
      "No, because my mother privatized my house. So my husband and I decided to keep it for our sons for the future. They are unlikely to live, but maybe in a few years the price of housing in foreign currency will rise again and it will be very expensive. So far, we have to pay for utilities and other things.\n",
      "Well, if this little child is sitting in the chair FORWARD, it's not so scary. It's worse if he's behind me and if he's constantly kicking in the back of my chair. I would then (in both cases) have my son transplanted, and I would have put my husband or myself in the problem chair and my husband and I would be changing. If the front seat were turned around and I was constantly rubbing something there, I wouldn't be making a comment to my mother. But if it was behind me, I would have asked to take the child away, I would have said that I was very physically ill.\n",
      "It's a Sunday. My husband and my youngest have left for dinner and, probably, they will come to my eldest son to order pizza and watch football together. When I come back, of course, I will sleep in the tent again. It's a blessing. This year we installed it in the quietest place, we have a place - a real miracle in miniature.\n",

      "Not a single person in this universe who has done or said evil about my son! Even if in a few years I meet in virtual or real life, I am writing a story about a trip to Africa.\n",
      "Why should I come? I don't drink alcohol at all, and personally I have a claim to the redhead - it is her attitude to my son. But if you know the address, I would ask some boy hooligans (who live in another district of Moscow) to write graffiti on the wall of her ride at night for a small sum of money, in letters of huge size - here in the apartment there is such a thief oxana - and her surname. Give the boys half of the money before and half of the money after you see the graffiti yourself. No one will ever find or even look for anyone who did it.\n",

      "I understand. But I know Margula very well. Margula, as the moderator of GODAMY, insulted my son, my family, dirty gossip about me with impunity. Margula and Red both harassed me for years. If only I would not pay attention. But my son. A small child. So I don't see any moral reward to politely pass on my friend's request to her.\n",
      "Well, let's finish our dialogue. If you are convinced that there are more beggars in France than in Russia, keep thinking like this. In our (adult) age, it is difficult to convince anyone of anything. I have lived in France for 33 years.\n",

He just asked his son if he knew where she lives in France, on her cell phone, her cell phone doesn't answer) He himself with Ho Chi Minh City and accompanied her and put her on a plane to Paris.\n",
      "But the brothers say they know nothing about the draft, nor about the fact that she allegedly had to drink all this time with one of them. In my opinion, she just arranged a love vacation with someone in France. She can't leave her children like this.\n",

      "The lawyer says that if this is done, and she suddenly comes forward, the bride can accuse her son of kidnapping her daughter.\n",
      "By the fact that the court decided that the daughter remains in the custody of MATERY. About the fact that the mother and her new husband do not want permanent residence in Vietnam - this, too, went through the court and the court decided that my son will see his daughter once a month, the daughter will be brought to France for a month, the parents pay for air tickets in stages. Naturally, in addition to this time, my son has also flown there to Vietnam twice, at his own expense, of course.\n",
      "In general, I told her, because the case is very unusual. I am not particularly worried, after all, despite all the shortcomings, my daughter-in-law loves her children. I think that she is growing up and will return to her new horned husband. My granddaughter is not in danger of anything. My son suggested that she come and take her away, she herself is not ready yet. She herself can return. I remember, until my eldest turned 14, we went every summer for 3 months to visit my mother in St. Petersburg. Often he flew alone, with two passports, no permits were asked by anyone at passport controls.\n",
      "No, he is not a stranger. They have lived together for a long time. My granddaughter does not complain about him at least.\n",

      "I don't know him well. I've only seen him once in my life. The rest I know about him is from the stories of my granddaughter and those of my son (they are forced to communicate).

      "We always buy round-trip tickets (tickets only) at the end of December for the next July or August, when my son has school holidays. So we go on our own, then over the next few months I gradually organize everything - I look at the route, book hotels, the car if necessary, and so on, I organize planing trips During all this time - anticipating such a huge positive emotion, it's great.\n",
      "I live now in an absolutely and beautifully renovated (cosmetic) house. It turned out to be very nice, cozy, comfortable. I regret that I waited many years before starting renovation.The second year of my son's college has confirmed completely his abilities for exact science and for studying in general - for him the future began to loom. I stopped being upset about my age, and on the contrary, I am even glad that the sooner it is over, the better.

But he works far away, it is possible that she will have to live with us for a week and enroll in the same college as my youngest son. She is 14 years old, in the autumn will be 15, and I have no experience with young girls!!!!!\n",
      "It means that my eldest is already out of childhood age, he is 34 years old!!!!!!!!!!! Some crap, author, where did you subtract that?

The photo is small, I can go down here for my friend and my son's mother. To say that this woman is 30 or 50 years old is the same thing.\n",
      "I want exactly what everyone wants. I want the maximum amount of money - it is the widest understanding and essence of the desires of all people. I want to make my two sons pleasant with them - for me the joy of giving to the people I love and making them happier exceeds the joy of receiving them. I don't want anything concrete from the material, the whole world and Jaconia have already been circumnavigated, the final quiet pier-house already exists, the pier that I adore. I just don't know what else I can want specifically for myself, if specifically.\n",
      "I don't understand why I started writing about bears and vodka. The author of the top asks if people remember pens with a pen in the USSR, where they had to pump ink from a bottle.

      "I would like to discuss a difficult situation in my life, concerning my son's piano teacher. I can write everything here, on the Russian website, because she herself will never be able to find out what is being discussed. I really had a useful view of the situation from the outside.

In Russia, racism is strong at the domestic level, and it will not be easy for your son's wife and future grandchildren to benefit from such a marriage. Well, in Burkina Faso, I think, they understand that there is no place for your son's permanent residence.\n",
      "We live in a small house. Ready to accept. My son's future wife will not be a stranger to me.

      "I have one son who is 36 years old (he has a granddaughter, 17 and a half years old) and another son who is almost 16 years old (he is almost 2 years younger than his niece). Theoretically (my granddaughter may give birth) then I will also be a great-grandmother. But I'm 57, you have broken my record!\n",
      "In principle, a month of school lunches if there are no vacations costs 60 euros.

Opposite mine. We both have the same mensary rooms.\n",
      "Yes, I remember they all came to my son's first and second confirmation, but then there were not 10, but 20 people. We were drinking champagne at home then, and then we all drove in cars to Château Thierry to the restaurant. But even for 15 people on Saturday you probably have to order resto in advance. I will tune in to the BBQ. Another delicate moment. We saw our granddaughter many times after the death of her mother, but the rest of her husband's family - for the first time after that with her.\n",

      "No, my son is silent as a guerrilla, I have had many conversations with him on this subject - he answers something briefly. Unfortunately, the age of our sons is such that it is difficult to get in touch.\n",
      "But no, he has other plans for the future. Actually, I wasn't so much complaining about the piety of my men as I was thinking that someone might advise me how to argue that he should not even kill on this Sunday morning. But there is probably no way of persuading me.\n",

The flying object (you wrote - a quardocopter) was given to my son by his older brother, and my husband ordered two other things over the Internet.\n",
      "When my son opened his boxes, I could only see it from afar. I could only see a watch close by, today, on his hand. A cool watch, you can access it on my YouTube. Only the screen is so small that I don't know if it's worth it. However, there are still a lot of different options, more useful, on this watch.\n",
      "The author, when the children have grown up, in school, everyone forgets how much someone has sat on the pot. I have completely forgotten this date about my sons.\n",
      "Author, I sympathize with your girl. It's not about leadership or non-leadership. But you have to have a friend in school, it's very, very important. Union is strength, then if one is sick, the other brings her homework, and so on. I thought about how to help her, but nothing goes into my head. Ask my daughter if there might be another girl in the class. Then let your daughter invite her to visit (to the cinema, I don't know where else) - to start a friendship.\n",
      "I have no idea how old boys start doing it. In normal families, parents are not told, and parents are not asked.\n",
      "When I became pregnant with my second child, my youngest, who was 21 years old, was very upset - I didn't say anything, but it was obvious that I was upset. And then when I gave birth to the second, soon I had a terrible desire to have another, for the maternal instinct plus there were some life circumstances. 'My husband and I really tried for a while to make the third.\n",
      "I believe. And my teenage son in China also has a lot of photos. But the fact that if she took a dollar for each photo, then the trip would be OKUPILAS (as you would have thought it would be necessary to photograph her child 200 times a day) - this, pardon me, is just \"exaggerating\" And in general, it is not clear why she wrote this.\n",
      "My son, aged 17, studied at the lyceum, met a girl 3 years older online and for very good reasons brought her to us LIVE. She lived for a year and a half, did nothing, did not work, did not study. From the very beginning, I made it a condition that they would not sleep together and lay out a bed for her at night. One afternoon, I went into my son's room and they slept there hugging.\n",
      "Well, I don't know. I am an atheist, but a good quote from the Bible is that God's ways are unrecognizable.\n",
      "And mine didn't sleep at all during the day. Or about 15 minutes, then an hour of sleep (only on my hands), then another 10 minutes of sleep, and so on.\n",
      "Well, you know, the circumstances are different. Life can bring bad surprises and a series of setbacks. Wealthy people, most of them, had start-up support, such as rich parents who could pay for their expensive and long education. Or an inheritance of some kind. What if parents are poor? If a talented person cannot afford to study after school because they have to work to survive?\n",
      "Well, let's say it's YOUR version and YOUR perception of life. Mine is different. It's a hundred times more pleasant for us to travel and live together. Right (for you) and you and me (for me). We were very happy to be together with our first son.\n",
      "If you don't believe that you can take a child to the southern hemisphere from the age of six and feel the most complete happiness - don't believe it. My sons don't complain about seeing the world from an early age. Believe me, seeing the world long before the age of 18 greatly increases a child's horizons and level of development and general culture.\n",
      "I gave birth at 21. Then I didn't want to for a long time. And when my son left the nest, I urgently wanted to give birth again and gave birth to my second at 42.\n",
      "I always buy something unusual and cool (not stupid useless souvenirs) to my husband's relatives from my annual trips to distant countries and to my friends as well. Virtually on all summer trips I buy gifts there for the upcoming Christmas. Yes, I often give my own crafts, too, if my girlfriend liked something from my collection and very much goes to her, I give it to her.\n",
      "At 3 years old, it's not just sitting with a child, it's a real job, it's not the easiest. It's every second attention. At 3 years old, personally, it was very difficult for me to spend time with both my sons at their 3 years old, even though I haven't worked like you. So the time you spend with your granddaughter-WOOOD is a perfectly normal time, even if your son-in-law's mother doesn't write that you don't spend enough time. And it's normal that at this age it's really boring to spend time with your children. Personally, I could play with a child of this age without exerting - an hour maximum.\n",
      "I don't even understand my explanations. I don't buy frozen meals. And fresh ones, prepared in the kind of house kitchens, should be kept in the fridge, not in the freezer, for a week at most. They are one-person portions and the most varied.\n",
      "The author understands you. I would also need a feather in your cap. But I am better off in this respect, my husband is at work during the week, my son is at school.\n",
      "But I will try to find a family where my confused child lives and I will try to persuade my parents to give it to me as well. If they don't want it (I certainly won't give away my non-native one), I will try to make friends with them and often communicate with them.\n",
      "But I don't want to think that humanity is so bad, and that in your case - your son and his girlfriend - will do to us what we did to them afterwards. In our case, it was a terrible scoundrel.\n",
      "And if my son and daughter-in-law hadn't done what they did, now I wouldn't have a second son, because as soon as I found out about the pregnancy of my (then) son's girlfriend, I immediately decided that the rest of my life would be spent with them, I thought that as long as they both studied I would be with my granddaughter as long as it took.\n",
      "And we didn't know where they were or if they were alive at all for a year and a half. Do you see? Only son. Lost in one day. Not at all. A year. I survived really only on antidepressants. In fact, it was three times more despicable, a disgusting betrayal, what he did, but I don't want to tell you all that.\n",
      "The oldest son was a child and had pocket money, he kept it under his mattress. I laid a mattress with a bed for him in his son's room on the carpet.\n",
      "You can't read? I wrote that he stole my sons \"money. At that time, I didn't have a single veil and I didn't even know about it and didn't think about it at all.\n",

      "Excellent results - I continue to renovate my house and now live in a very pleasant interior (everyday life has become more pleasant). My son is happy with my excellent studies, we have bought tickets for a long voyage5 for the next summer- all of us, mainly my son, are looking forward to another interesting adventure.\n",
      "The song of the wind, M-das, saviboo! Now it's time to renovate my son's room, and the descendant will go down to the guest room, and in the summer it will be the house from the outside, the paint will be repainted, and so on.\n",
      "The child is fine. We are fine. Because the first son has grown up and now he has his own life, and my husband and I have an excellent second life.\n",
      "I am a mother of two boys. For me, it is unacceptable for my son and his bride-wife to \"sit on his neck.\" He is an organic part of my family, if good for them, good for me and my husband.\n",
      "Well, \"your people\" are family. Husband, children. It is clear that you need always, everyone, and at any age.. Are you an author? Have you lost friends for different reasons and are you sad about it? Believe me, in 10 years, the sadness from this will completely pass. But a few years will still have to sink in.\n",
      "And how is it possible - if you come to visit, ignore them and carry on with household chores? They will sit silently on the sofa like loafers? We only have conversations over tea if the eldest son comes, he finds something to do for himself. And if the guests, of course, we take care of the guests.\n",
      "I don't agree. One day, almost every teenager becomes a revolutionary and starts to try things that are forbidden.\n",
      "I have an older son wearing an earring (he made a hole in a jewellery shop himself when he was 12) I like it.\n",
      "Yes! I have already written this to the author. It turns out that some company is waiting for her there. So she won't be alone anymore. PS. I also love China, I went to India for the second time just to show the country to my son, he wanted to, but I won't go there myself. Especially to Goa.\n",
      "The author and I have similar situations. This boy is my youngest son and calls me my mother. And this girl is my granddaughter, who is almost 2 years older than her son, calls me grandma 3648x2736 (753.15 kB) www.fotolink.su\n",
      "No one calls me a grandmother except my granddaughter. Before the birth of the second, I looked really young. When my granddaughter was born, I became a de facto grandmother - I was not believed.\n",
      "And I regularly collect all the rubbish in the same way (about what you have listed) - in the children's room and throw it away in secret from him while he is at school. Or else he clings to every little thing to leave behind. And with his eldest son, all his childhood and adolescence was like that.\n",
      "And I have a granddaughter who is 25 percent Vietnamese, 25 percent Russian, and 50 percent French. It turned out to be a beauty with slightly slanted eyes, but exactly the same color of light green as mine (and her father and mother with black eyes). And when I compare the photos of my youngest son with those of my eldest son when he was younger, they are like twin brothers, even scary somehow.\n",
      "And how do you know your lineage so deeply? Serfdom was officially abolished in the middle of the 18th century. So how old is your great-grandmother if she remembers it all?\n",
      "A happy woman that life is beautiful is your opinion and your belief and it is true. For you. But this opinion is strictly personal and for others it has the right to be different. Personally, I believe that life is so unbeautiful that I feel guilty to both sons because I gave birth to them. And I will never forgive my mother for having given birth to me.\n",
      "I think it would have been better for them not to have been born (as it is for all of us). But this is purely my personal philosophy.\n",
      "Yes. Absolutely. In my opinion, we were all very unlucky that we were born. I am an atheist, but if we take such concepts as hell and paradise, I think that our life is hell for some sins in a past, better life. And I think that rather than experience as you write \"a lot of unpleasant things\" - even if parents help-this unpleasant things in life so much (mathematically times more times than pleasant moments), it is better not to be born at all to experience these moments.\n",
      "But how do you initially create even the smallest company if a person has left school, his parents can't help, there is unemployment in the country and he has found a job in a maxdo? All his salary is spent, as it is written in this text, on rent, food, transportation to work. No bank will give him a loan.\n",
      "And now they have compared me to these three photos. On the first one I am there before the entrance with my husband, on the second one with my eldest son, then still a child, on the third one inside, at the bulletin board of the Secretariat of our department There are lecture schedules and other information.\n",
      "I will go to the farm, not far from where the farmers have opened a shop, buy cottage cheese, fresh milked milk and something tasty made of meat. On Sunday, we will make a special dinner, the eldest son and 4 guests (two French-Russian couples) will arrive.\n",
      "How can one ever think that raising the retirement age would be a good thing? The lower the retirement age, the richer and more prosperous a country is.\n",
      "I like this. Personally, I am often asked for permission to photograph (when I am beautifully dressed), I happily agree. In exotic countries, it happens that children ask to photograph with a child. And with the eldest son we were in China a long time ago, he was a teenager, so there in general very often girls of his age (in groups and laughing) - asked him to photograph with them on their cameras.\n",
      "We lightened up my son's room. I removed Venecia from the door and replaced it with New York City, a very light sticker. And I put a light blue kerb under the ceiling all around the perimeter. I wanted to show you about it in the Interior, but I don't want to cause any trouble to Elenium.\n",
      "On the box it was written that from 18. Heads are flying off, but I didn't see the elements of sex. If I had seen the game right away I would have thrown it away. However, I didn't watch him play. I got into a row with my husband because he bought this game, and my husband forced me to do something \"graphic there is beautiful.\" I am terribly glad that my son abandoned the game and even lost everything else.\n",
      "No one does lessons for my child. My son does lessons himself. But he only wants excellent grades and so his husband checks his lessons with him, so it is easier to work.\n",
      "Naturally, he did not become a professional, but now in his life piano is a hobby. Ln constantly learns different passages and plays, and finds joy in it.\n",
      "My two sons enjoy learning classics (Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven). Personally, I am currently developing Tchaikovsky's Concerto No. 1. But this is a difficult level for me. I also search the Internet for a score of melodies for songs that I like for my right hand, and for my left hand I pick up the chords myself.\n",
      "The table is decorated by the younger son. Dessert cake is usually brought by one of the guests. NG party lasts a long time, many dishes are provided, it is necessary to systematically clean dirty plates and put new ones in, well, at the table - something to clean up, something to bring, change napkins to remove empty bottles, put new drinks, change rbms - glasses and so on. I do this and my two sons.\n",
      "A good poem, another anonym. But it does not answer the question at all. \"There lived in the heart\" is a kind of sweet abstraction, my child's mind is rather mathematical and logical (not one 4 in the whole school year).\n",
      "I'm not saying that \"fiction\" is a hypothesis, but I don't believe it. And the child has already chosen it. He believes like a papa.\n",
      "(By the way, I once bought a lemon tree in a clay pot, and a few of the lemons were already hanging there, so it died) But the question is where the grain originally came from. So you think there was a chicken or an egg in the first place. By the way, after school, he goes to collect eggs from our chickens, ask him what he thinks about it. Or is it better not to ask?\n",
      "Well... he used to ask, but childishly and was satisfied with the answer that Dad put a grain in Mum, and then he went from grain to bebe and then was born. Now he wants to know where the grain came from and where it was up to Mum's belly - that's how he formulates the question.\n",
      "They are different, such electronic keyboards - different number of keys, different options, and so on. I think on average 300 euros, but you will buy a used keyboard, cheaper, having checked if it works. There are a lot of different buttons. We bought a Yamaha and a piano from us, too. Here is our keyboard, stands for not while we put it on the table for the TV. The eldest son bought himself a good keyboard, with absolutely all the keys, because he also plays, but there is no real piano and no money to buy it.\n",
      "Olga, it is not. It is absolutely terrible what you say. Because to the bitterness that parents are poor to add to the sense of guilt - (others at my age do what they want, and I am worthless so I should) Which child himself achieved something in life? Can you give Pavlik Morozov as an example, saying that he is very honest and principled, betrayed his parents, but then he was appointed to a well-paid post.\n",
      "My youngest son is probably almost a mathematical wunderkind. He multiplies and divides the many-character cypher in his mind, even the teacher at the school checks the results of the calculator and is surprised. And my eldest son barely and hardly learned mathematics, as I probably did.\n",
      "I think, in the slimy weather, when you can't go outside, everyone goes crazy. Especially if the child is alone, there are no brothers and sisters. Unfortunately, mine is sitting in front of the TV. And what else to do.\n",
      "Yes, the question is really stupid, because the answer is obvious. I think the only way to raise a confident child is to be confident first of all - and mother and father. So that confidence is not ostentatious, but true, and manifests itself in every action and gesture of daily life (without slipping into arrogance and rushing in relation to other people of course) Who knows any other way to nurture self-confidence? And there are mothers who suffer terribly morally when they see that a child is shy and shy? I had such a first son.\n",
      "Another problem, perhaps. My husband is smart, but sometimes stubborn and stupid. I read somewhere that cell phones are bad for the brain and flatly refuses to buy a cell phone for my son.\n",
      "Well, it is understandable if the daughter is not a beauty, in no way to talk about such a topic and not to say, nothing, daughter, is not in beauty happiness. I am to what this top started. There were a lot of tops about envy and suddenly I realized that if I had a daughter, I would be envious probably of the beauty of other girls - in comparison to her.\n",
      "Author, if a son or daughter gets married with or without children, it is absolutely normal for me to live in all of them. And my role (as a grandmother) is to help as much as I can, especially since I do not work.\n",
      "Do you already have children or grandchildren? My ex-daughter-in-law wants to emigrate to Vietnam. In this case, of course, I will lose my beloved granddaughter.\n",
      "And here's my record! This man is 30 years younger than me and 10 years younger than my son 3648x2736 (601.08 kB) image hosting 3648x2736 (723.37 kB) image hosting So, alas, everything in the world happens.\n",
      "My son is 29 years old. He works, is divorced and has a daughter, she has stayed with her mother. We help him financially, and he often helps when men's hands are needed, for example, when a swimming pool is installed for the summer.\n",
      "... that's what I learned about my son's new friend, there is a photo of her in his passport. She is wearing a lilac jacket and jeans, we are standing next to each other on the stump of a former cherry tree.\n",
      "But I absolutely don't want to help him in anything. I promised Arhane and if she doesn't spend until the summer, I will give them each other's coordinates. I have already told my son about her. But how can he lie and hide such things for months.\n",
      "I found out the details. I have been watching the forum from the very beginning, I see the gloating and the transition to me and my clothes for some reason. I don't even know who to tell you. I'll tell you what. She passed a state competition after school (to become any functionary in France, you have to pass a state competition, and at what level a functionary it depends on the level of diplomacy. She had a tank certificate of maturity. She got a job working on the podium. There, she started a fight with a police colleague, a man, and throwing something heavy at him, caused serious damage to her health.\n",
      "Correct. Your advice won't suit me. Because when I feel bad, I go to a forum and often-often-get psychological support. My son knows by the way that I write a lot about our family on forums and it doesn't bother him at all. I'm not asking for advice here.\n",
      "Author, they won't last long and your son will find a girl of his own age. I am 49 years old and here I am in love correspondence with a 19-year-old as well. I wrote not in love, but in love correspondence. It's very funny.\n",
      "It was a terrible and deeply traumatic experience - most children have a father, protection and support, and I don't have one. But it didn't affect my family, I've been married for 30 years, for the same two sons.\n",
      "MMMM - Author, the situation is so complicated and serious that it is impossible to analyze the situation without knowing the entire history of your life, beginning with your childhood. It is very strange that you write. You know, when I had an only son and grew up and committed a huge meanness, I then survived on Prozac.... I then found the only way not to rush in and give birth to another son.\n",
      "He doesn't know because he is still a little boy. When he grows up and is old enough to understand, I will tell him everything. I love him more than anything in the world, the youngest.\n",
      "Not so. I will tell him what happened then. And of course I will say that yes, having remained in the bacchum, after the betrayal of the closest person and alone, I gave birth to another child because I had to love someone. Maybe it was a mechanical reason that pushed me to give birth so late, but my youngest turned out to be truly a gift of fate.\n",
      "No, I understand the curiosity of the anonymous, If I were not Leeson, I would also be interested in what happened to Leeson and her son there. I just can't talk about it.\n",
      "Ah, well, yes. But my situation with my mother has nothing to do with my sons. If I can't write about my eldest son here because I'm afraid to remember what happened, I'm too lazy to write about the situation with my mother, I don't care about it, and - here the situation with her doesn't traumatize me at all, just laziness to write.\n",
      "Hi. And my mother has never seen her second grandchild (8 years old) or her great-granddaughter (almost 10 years old) in her life.\n",
      "On the contrary, if I didn't have a single SYN, but only a daughter (or daughters), I wouldn't know what it's like to be a mother. Imho, imho.\n",
      "I would not want a girl in Russia. There is too much competition for 10 girls-9 children. True, there is a future army with a boy in Russia. After all, the boys are trout! IMHO.I have one son who is already an adult, and there are 2 men in the family, not one.\n",
      "I probably judge by myself, I would not be able to build a relationship with a man with a child. And my son says that on dating sites, here in France, as soon as they find out that he has a daughter, they stitch him up.\n",
      "What kind of mother would tell about her son in such terms. And what you are terrified of is incomprehensible. The woman does not offer to take the child to me, but to my son. She offered it to him herself and the main thing daughter herself now wants (when they divorced, she wanted to stay with her mother) still rules the ball only bj and everything will depend only on her decision. The son himself very much wants to take the daughter away, the question is whether she will be able to do so without judicial red tape.\n",
      "But no, after all this, I can no longer consider the elder not as a scoundrel. And your friend is French, he was the only son of his parents? Write that he now has a guilt complex, and mine does not. We have a taboo on this subject, because he says that it was. Probably, he doesn't feel any guilt, or he eats it very deeply.\n",
      "Riki, you got it right. And then they started reasoning that my son has a forest in his life. He is terribly happy, he will go to the town hall, maybe they will still enroll in school if the mother gives a receipt that she agrees to it. So that my granddaughter would live with me all the time during the week and I would drive them to the same school with the younger one, the son would not agree. He lives 50 km from NasTT so as not to smear it, or else he would lie and inexpensively take it.\n",
      "It is clear. Judging by the answer you have just such a sad case. \"The main thing is that the child is healthy and happy.\" Moreover, my son is not clear why they stitched it together. Probably, you are a mother who subconsciously or not very subconsciously assesses the appearance of her daughters not in their favor.\n",
      "So you didn't understand my question. Telling your daughter that she is ugly is disgusting and horrible and you shouldn't. I'm talking about what mothers think in their heads if their daughter is very ugly. Do they comfort themselves with arguments that happiness is not beauty? I would suffer terribly. That's why I ask.\n",
      "What if beautiful is stupid, unhappy, and terrible? Don't mix it up. The percentage of happy among beautiful and ugly is roughly the same. Beautiful is easier to live with. I am very glad that my granddaughter is a beauty, because being dishonest and beautiful is better than being unhappy and ugly, moreover.\n",
      "And how not to stumble? It's dark in our village, there is no traffic lights, all the lights don't work, the batteries are down. My husband and son asked where I had run.\n",
      "Chess club plays with adults at tournaments. Piano music. As for my appearance, I consider my sons beautiful, but for a boy it is not as important as for a girl 3648x2736 (638.54 kB) hosting images\n",
      "And a thin thread of lips. Do you know, there are such types of faces, whose ugly make-up and talents cannot be changed. If I had such a daughter, I would be running to see a plastic surgeon at 18.\n",
      "I think that in France they are more likely to find a criminal than in Russia. Here, after all, there is more order and less security, the country is smaller, and the European police cooperate with each other. Yes, the material base is probably more modern and equipped.\n",
      "In France, it is taboo to have statistics on the nationality of the criminals who are in prison here. My husband has one brother, a gendarme, and once worked in prison. There are 70 percent Arabs and 29 Negroes.\n",
      "Last year, when we were flying home from Cuba, there, after checking in our luggage, we had to stand in a huge hopeless queue of people departing all flights to pay the exit tax. The queue is at least 2 hours long. I see an airport employee in line looking for people with small children and brings them to the window outside of the queue. Well, I, too, got to the window, followed by a negro, and demonstratively lead my son by the hand (my son is 8 years old) Well, people probably thought that a negro is also leading us without a queue, no one said anything. And in general, I hate people who brazenly climb without a queue.\n",
      "I didn't want any more children at all, but my life took a turn, quite unexpectedly, so that if I hadn't given birth (at 42), life would have stopped for me at all, and I don't know if I would have lived at all now.\n",
      "That's how I thought, I just wasn't sure. So you understand me that when people write nasty things to me here, I don't react particularly, but when the kids get hurt at least a little bit, I become very angry. And my granddaughter.... My ex-son plays cat-and-mouse with my son and me and my husband. Here's your granddaughter! Give your granddaughter away! You won't see your granddaughter again! If you want me to give you a grandchild! Up and down, up and down, there is no more emotional strength to follow this rollercoaster.\n",
      "Look, here I am just 42 years old and just gave birth for the second time. One son is 21 years old, also in pictures, another has just been born and I am the happiest mum in the world.\n",
      "But whether a wounded and immature teenager has the mental strength to say this with unplayable contempt and indifference - I doubt it. Let all relationships with this boy and others who have been in this company end. What a pity that we parents are not able to separate our children from such vital shit.\n",
      "And I have been traveling for a long time, and I have hardly ever worked. My husband works, and I am in the village. And there is an adult son and a granddaughter from him.... True, there is another son, a little one. But I have already found my quiet haven. Here I will stay until I die, I like it here. But I have no idea when my husband will retire, it will not be soon - and the small one will probably leave the family already.... No change in life is foreseeable.\n",
      "If the dull moderator deigns to agree that my son (8 years old) and his problems have the right to appear here. We have a very incomprehensible situation. I will ask people to write here, if someone is ready to listen to me and advise me, or if I describe the problem sincerely here again, and after an hour it will be buried or nobody is interested, then I will not write anything better.\n",
      "Oh. I'm sitting writing, and they're next to me in my son's room. She was sleeping there on the floor, on a mattress.\n",
      "My youngest is also crazy about cleanliness, even when he visits, if he sees a stain on his plate, he goes to wash. He is also a hypochondriac, when he is sick with, say, angina, he asks if he is going to die seriously. At the slightest wound, he demands to be taken to a doctor.\n",
      "I follow the surest law of complaints - to complain over the head of a small boss to a big boss. That is, if I go directly to the principal, and if the conflict is serious, I take the child out of school for a few days and write the same letter - many copies to all pyramid authorities up to the Ministry of Education. I mark the square of each copy where other letters have gone. I can write perfectly similar letters, with excellent arguments and ominous threats, updated with perfect politeness. My husband is a journalist, but he only corrects if there are spelling and syntax errors, meaning-never.\n",
      "I will tell you two examples with the elder. One case was in elementary school. On a change, my son fought with some boy (I don't know who was to blame there) The boy complained to the teacher and she, judging by the conflict only from the boy's words, stood next to my son and told her that the boy hit-gave-a-pass-to my son. The second time it was at the lyceum.\n",
      "He slept for half an hour or at most. And day and night it was like that. I wasn't crazy because my husband, as soon as he came home from work, took care of the baby completely. And at night he swaddled me, half-asleep, half-asleep, half-breast, and so on. And on weekends, too.\n",
      "I didn't understand the last phrase - how does my son (and which of the two) allow me to \"come off\"????? I would be jealous daily and throughout my life, nibbling on a pillow at night and crying at injustice, why they give birth and I don't. It wouldn't be envy-hatred of women who give birth, it would be envy-bitterness that would just emphasize why they, not me.\n",
      "Hi hi. Once again hi. It's a pity that I can't show you the photos from our meetings, because I'm not sure that everyone would agree. However, one friend definitely agrees, now if I find her photo I'll show it.\n",
      "I swear by the life of my children, I have not done anything other than what I enumerated. I say, there is still a bit of witchcraft.\n",
      "Why should the author and her son see a psychologist? Whoever is harassing is what. Author, don't listen to anonymity, you don't need to see any psychologist.\n",
      "author sorry you write anonymously I can't send my email to your pass, and if I ask you to send yours to mine it may not matter who from here. Or maybe now this top will be deleted or you and I will be banned\n",
      "And my eldest son, when he was still a teenager and we were on a long night flight from Los Angeles to Paris with American Airlines, managed to pull out an inflatable life jacket from under his seat and put it in his backpack, which was lying under the seats on the floor.\n",
      "Radziwil, when my second son was 6 months old, I was diagnosed with a neurological diagnosis that was 50 / 50. 50 recovery, 50 death or stroke. Then I had a hard time arguing with my husband that if I had a stroke, he would help me to leave, but I couldn't. I blackmailed him by telling him that if he didn't promise me, I would leave immediately and I could still do it myself. Do you have a husband?\n",
      "...... and here, for example, you are a secular enterprise, this is my son and I photograph him. So don't get hung up on non-working dams - places where you can walk around with new outfits-3648x2736 (693.85 kB) Photohosting\n",

      "How wonderful it is to fly to San Francisco, rent a car for a month and ride it for a month in the mountains, deserts and cities of the Far West, staying in motels for a night or two if the place is attractive or in Las Vegas, for example, at the call of the heart. Our first, now adult, son then went with us when he was a teenager and squealed with delight from these trips.\n",
      "At 7: 30. We now have one car to take my husband to the station. Then I go home and take my son to school without 5: 9 (the station is near the school, 5 min by car). Then I come back and if there are no plans to go to bed again. My son has lunch at school, so my day is until evening.\n",
      "And why do you find it strange to deny the existence of higher forces? To me, this is not strange at all, but, on the contrary, logical. And if they were, they are abhorrent, otherwise they would not have allowed a million innocent souls to die in the entire history of mankind (because there are many children's souls). The worst thing that can happen is to have the misfortune to be born in this life. And no one has asked me if I want to be born and live!\n",
      "However, milk and water can also be left in the trunk. Yes. We have a lot of milk a week. My son often drinks hot chocolate, my husband also drinks a lot of it for some reason. And cats. My son often cooks different cupcakes and cakes where milk is needed.\n",
      "I answered clearly. I live because my family needs me. I am not interested in \"living\" this way. I have read all the books, I have seen the whole world, and I have lived 10 lives of an ordinary person based on actions and situations.\n",
      "What do you like? Peace? Most people like it, because, in principle, when we are born, we are all programmed for this life. That's why most people live and rejoice that they live without being evil. And that's fine. Very few people like the world. Those who are intellectually able to dig deeper + tend to be cynical and pessimistic. But both are right. Everyone has their own truth and vision of the world.\n",
      "Are there women in nature who mow the grass themselves or cut thick branches with electric saws? These are heavy tools for a woman, aren't they? I have a husband and an older son who do this.\n",
      "I get up at 7, because I have to take my husband, who works in Paris, to the train station. Then I take my youngest son to school by 9. I have free time all day, my son has lunch at school. I go to bed early, at 9 o'clock.\n",
      "And why do we need dogs and cats? He is our favorite. He is castrated, so he does not fertilize anyone. There are no goats around us. Often, friends come to our son and they let the goat off the leash and follow him around the garden, he runs and jumps amusingly.\n",

      "Everyone dresses normally neutral, jeans, pullovers, etc., and my son, too. He only dressed like that once (without handcuffs) - everyone was surprised, the kids from the class asked where it came from and some teachers asked what kind of uniform it was. And that's it, he didn't wear the overalls anymore.\n",
      "It is one thing and the most important thing. THAT WAS NOT STREET AND HUGE AS EVERYTHING WAS EVERYTHING IT WAS. I was brought up by life itself to acquire these qualities. It was very long and very bad for me to achieve these qualities. I didn't want my son to have to acquire these qualities through thorns.\n"
